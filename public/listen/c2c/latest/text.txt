from the heartland of America and the gateway to the west to good morning good evening where ever you may be across the nation around the world I'm George nori welcome to Costco stay and later on tonight the producers of that great film what the bleep joins us here's what's happening the Las Vegas gunmen behind the deadliest mass shooting the biggest in modern U. S. history spent decades apparently stockpiling guns and living a very secret life that investigators still may never be able to piece together to fully understand what happened Clark County Nevada sure of Joseph Lombardo said that it was only logical to make the assumption that Stephen paddock had some kind of help at some point in pulling off Sunday's massacre in Las Vegas as evidence Lombardo pointed to a gunman paddocks huge arsenal explosive materials found in his car and his meticulous planning he also may have been planning shootings in Chicago and Boston as well twenty four year old Washington woman who dreamed of becoming a serial killer by murdering a man she met online is eating out his heart has been sentenced to eighteen years in prison Amy Carolyn brown pleaded guilty last month to attempting to kill a twenty nine year old man that she met on Craigslist in January after she stabbed him in the long with a pocket knife the victim told police that he met brown on Craigslist and that the two one on a date that ended up at the sea Adil area motel the man told what police that brown asked him several times if he was a serial killer and of course she said no on the twenty four year old jumped on I'm attacked him stabbed with a knife nuclear armed North Korea said that its missile launches were training for a strike on US bases in Japan as global condemnation of the regime begins to swell Charles R. Smith our expert on Korea with us Charles I know what you've been saying over the months that you do not believe there's going to be the our our military conflict here but I thought I'd ask you again is there are nothing on the horizon as of yet although we have some events in the mid month with the celebration of the October Revolution and the %HESITATION Chinese Congress meeting so it's quite possible that the north Koreans may decide to set up a firecracker worsened up a bottle rocket yes they do that again on the are you just have a feeling that the this administration is going to retaliate well arm if it's over Japan like they did last time we may just sit back and watch it aimed at eighty U. S. territories such as Guam %HESITATION there might be a different reaction so we'll have to see a again and we've seen some motions in different areas of for example in the cyberspace the area we had a denial of service attack where we the United States applied a deal esoteric against the north Korean reconnaissance bureau however it seems that the north Koreans have moved and by using your connection with the Russians have established a brand new internet connection through a trans telcom is a state owned firm in Russia Charlie does Japan have the capability to fight back on its own against North Korea are no it doesn't it doesn't have the offense of capability that's something that they are reviewing are there has been discussion by the abbey government to %HESITATION purchase a cruise missiles for longer range strike %HESITATION in it's in part impartial because of their reluctance to arm themselves with the offense with weapons so no the Japanese probably do not have the offense of punch to do so but could if they wished okay Charles will check in with you are next week the centers for disease control and prevention says that dozens of people have been sickened with infections link to poppy sold at Petplan pet stores the outbreak has affected fifty five people in twelve states thirteen people have been hospitalized this is an increase from the thirty nine cases reported in seven states last month infections can be spread by contact with dog Arab feces October's full harvest moon will shine all night tonight while passing buyer fully covering Neptune in some parts of the world in the predawn hours you also get another celestial show with Mars and Venus close together in the eastern sky listen to this story I Casper Wyoming man claiming to be from the future has been arrested for having too much to drink in the present time Casper police officer say around ten thirty PM they were dispatched to a residence on east second street for Amanda was stating that he was from the future and he was there to help people they found Brian Johnson who claimed he was from the year twenty forty eight and was trying to warn the people of Casper Wyoming that aliens were coming next year and they should leave as soon as possible he added that he wanted to speak to the president the time now what else is going on in the skies let's check in with Peter Davenport from the national UFO reporting center Peter would have forces when I listen to it is a news report you put on Georgian %HESITATION I don't feel quite as strange studying U. S. closes might otherwise be there's a lot going on and I was just out looking at the moon tonight beautiful full moon gorgeous it's really something well I we just updated our website posted about a hundred and forty one new reports collected over the last %HESITATION seven days one takes us back to the late nineteen sixties a very very intriguing report submitted by a gentleman who is writing on behalf of a friend of his a young woman age ninety two who had a friend age ninety four who worked on the lunar surveyor project back in the late nineteen sixties he just tragically passed away very shortly ago but towards the end of his life she reports he confided in her some very intriguing reports about the things that the lunar surveyors allegedly detected on this surface of the moon they found a collapsed domes machine debris kilometers of various surface tracks in numerous buildings %HESITATION if anybody's interested in what was going on in NASA back in the nineteen sixties I commend that report to their attention more recently eight days ago touch tone in Trenton Pottstown %HESITATION Pennsylvania gentleman writes that he and his daughter were flying from Pottstown which is up north west of %HESITATION Philadelphia to Trenton and on their way it's only about a forty or fifty mile trip they looked out ahead of their aircraft and they saw the Reds cylindrical shaped object oriented vertically in the sky he the pilot the father got on the horn and call the air traffic control system ask them if they had anything out ahead of them at his altitude technically there should have been enough in their George but it wasn't they just did not see it on radar they reported negative negatively they %HESITATION could not see it at all very interesting report more recently %HESITATION last night in the Portland area to very well prepared very convincing reports of a white light that was seen streak in at a very low altitude apparently and apparently just ahead of a heavy military helicopter streaking very close to Portland International Airport in the final report comes from flint Michigan this morning seven thirty AM %HESITATION husband and wife team drivers truck drivers saw approximately ten diamond shaped objects with the very intensely bright light on top of that they tracked them for several minutes before the objects just suddenly accelerated and slipped away so that a lot going on and I commend %HESITATION these reports and many others to the attention of the coast listeners you got it Peter thank you Peter Davenport from the national UFO reporting center up next William Keller joins me democracy betrayed the rise of the surveillance security state next on coast to coast idea okay welcome back to coast to coast with our special guest William Keller his work is called democracy betrayed William has worked as a security analyst for the United States Congress for ten years as the executive director of the center for International Studies at MIT as well as professor of international affairs and director of the Ridgeway center for the international security studies at the university of Pittsburgh most recently he served as a professor and director of the center for international trade and security at the university of Georgia he has held the highest security secure security clearances and has written extensively about the FBI defense technology multinational corporations and the arms trade William Keller with us on coast to coast pretty prolific author as well William welcome to the show thanks George rehab I'm looking forward to the you know we have and we're going through some weird strange times these days aren't we it does appear to be that way yes are we being manipulated to do you think they know I'm going to get into the things that have changed since like nine eleven in a minute with you but in your opinion is all this necessary what's happening well if you mean that all of the preparations we've made for terrorist attacks and all the investment we've made into it is is that the question yeah sort of there's going to be a follower by injustice I okay well I would say that since seven nine eleven we really have constructed but what I call security industrial complex and that's analogous to what Eisenhower talked about one in his last speech to the nation when he talked about the military dust real complex but there's a difference there and that's because the military is a typically out of the directed against our enemies %HESITATION but this complex %HESITATION is comprised of seventeen intelligence agency and it's not just the ones you know about like the CI a the FBI happy I and the National Security Agency it's all also the really less well known ones like the bureau of intelligence at state and the office of intelligence and counter intelligence that the energy department and the national geospatial intelligence agency so you know about if I tried to separate all out all these agencies it's tough to do probably speaking %HESITATION there is a national intelligence program that would be got the FBI and the DIA and there's separate from that a military intelligence program that would be like the defense intelligence in the National Security Agency but the division is not all that clear because you have the CIA and it seems to be in the middle that has national missions and it has military missions like out of the drone assassinations it carries out Scott don't bases in number of countries %HESITATION so to me the security industrial complex %HESITATION is really more than this clues not just of the department it includes also the department of homeland security and many elements of state and local police and and get destroyed the high tech companies in the commercial sector like Google eighteen anti Verizon apple %HESITATION they've been very complicity conducting surveillance on American citizens so I would say all of these entities are conducting massive surveillance %HESITATION most often or very often over the internet %HESITATION and the government a portion of the loan comes to about a hundred and twenty billion dollars a year while that's a big figure you know if you thought of what you do with a hundred twenty billion dollars you probably knocked down every %HESITATION elementary and high school in the country and build brand new until new ones insulate the power grid against %HESITATION in EMP attackers solar flare we could do all kinds of things with but things we don't know what you guys are doing %HESITATION and there's there are hundreds of thousands of government employees and contractors it is just the sheer size and magnitude the severity of the surveillance security state it's really unprecedented and the only benchmark we have I guess I I wanna talk for too long but look if you want me to go on I will not go you with me for two hours we both realize the title in with it's that the %HESITATION the one question that we have is the church committee which %HESITATION but the committee congratulatory but he they got together we've put together in nineteen seventy five and the idea was to investigate all the programs that the FBI and the intelligence agency I put together that threaten the American society at that time and this was done this very strange in a town called media Pennsylvania some Vietnam antiwar group broke into the FBI office stole their secret files and then they start released the single York Times and the wallstreet journal was the wikileaks before we had wikileaks wasn't yeah this is just a up an actual breaking where they took the real paper yeah I'll never this before we have real computers not turn then what happened was the Congress got so up in arms make sure to senator the Hon and Walter Mondale who later became vice president of much bothers %HESITATION really brought the intelligence committee %HESITATION under control all the commuting whole community under control %HESITATION they cut their budgets they publish their secret documents and they really made them accountable to the American people %HESITATION for the first time well %HESITATION here's the question but then along comes nine eleven years later we thought we had to sort of be you know that we get intelligence community that's right size for the mission to test undertake but since nine eleven we've actually could Drupal the size of it even more than that and I would say that that if Congress does not have the power how to rein in the intelligence agencies and and the security industrial complex if it should decide to do so you know with with this tragedy that occurred to Sunday night in Las Vegas how come we don't have the capability of somewhere along the line picking up something from this not job who obviously was planning this for a long long time and now we're here today William that he wanted to do the same thing in Chicago or Boston as well why doesn't the intelligence services pick up anything like that it might have been as well or it might have been instead you know %HESITATION and usually when a terrorist is caught like the ones that die shot up Harrison and in other places in recent years %HESITATION they typically issues we do know about the it's if you can't keep surveilling them now there's also there's this phenomenon of the of the single security point failure and what that means is that only one person knows that something's going to happen and if they don't tell anybody there and they don't make any records there really is no defense this guy was so extensive what he didn't in it in Las Vegas you know getting all those special stopped for his gun and having so many weapons you would have thought somebody would slag him so what would a flag that this guy what workers do you need to have you know would have twelve months stocks yeah yeah yeah absolutely and and it was really need that for because %HESITATION you know who's been so these things to fly under the radar and that's a that's a very tough thing to figure out well when you say the fly under the radar do the flying under the radar because of I'm a mistake or something has gone awry or does the technology simply mess it well there's there's the rub I mean you have to think about %HESITATION that's how so many people you're actually talking about you see because %HESITATION if these people don't exhibit some kind of behavior don't have a criminal record that really part makes them out standing in it so they get brought to the attention the police %HESITATION then it's very hard to pick them up so what's the reaction has been since nine eleven is to build ever more powerful surveillance platform indeed into upgrade surveillance technology and to begin to look at many many things in people's lives I need let's say for instance this guy one online over the past couple years to look at all kinds of things animal rifles assault weapons or places to go with that have become because were surveillance is everywhere would that have caught him with that a flag them yeah I see what you're you're you're punching a hole and now it's very interesting is through the real strategy these eyes and our strategy is to cover everything to look at everything yeah and have more information and more information and it's not a very effective strategy would you want to do is focus on the things that really that the people who really matter or the things that really matter %HESITATION and I guess now's a good time to point out that in the United States there's very little terrorism almost none and yet do you know that when people are surveyed in public opinion polls over fifty percent of the people say that they believe they are members their family %HESITATION will be a victim of terrorist and you know when you say those very little almost none arm of course we have not eleven we of the Boston Marathon we've had subscribed I are you saying we have very little on an ongoing basis or would not what did you mean by that you have to go back to nineteen seventy one we had about four hundred fifty terrorist events and then you come forward and it's been dropping steadily so that %HESITATION but I know IT and by nineteen %HESITATION well I would say by nineteen ninety %HESITATION we had maybe like twenty five terrorist events and then by the time we get to nine eleven we got like fifteen and then after that there's like ten or three install meters is zero terrorist acts Houston Texan with us we're gonna take a quick break but we'll be right back William Keller with us his work is called democracy betrayed the subtitle of course means a lot to the rise of the security of the surveillance security state well our annual goes to go show will be Tuesday October thirty first Halloween nights and we'd like you to email us some of your best and favorite ghost stories because you could get on the air that night email your name and phone number in that great ghost story to ghost stories and ghost ghost name dot com pull information as well as our carousel that coast coasting dot com but ghost stories at coast to coast am dot com might include your phone number your name and your goal story and welcome back to Costa because George nor you with you William Keller with us democracy betrayed is his latest work he's got several others out there arm in arm the liberals and J. Edgar Hoover I'd love to talk with you one day about Hoover William that would be a great show it could we could do that back to nine eleven for some we put the wheel when all this was happening or did they know something was happening and they just said let slip just let it happen because look at the things we can do afterward what do you think well I will I would just be the gassing of in this in this instance because I don't have any real direct it no data or information on the subject but %HESITATION I can't believe that %HESITATION if they had known about it they wouldn't stop to it's just too horrendous an event in in the history of mankind so I just I suspect that we were just cost me think about this %HESITATION for many many years if you could never traveled Israel George I have not well it would like to do that when I made that when you go to Israel you'll you'll find that all the security is in place and in fifteen years ago or twenty years ago before nine eleven all of Israel cockpits were hard with this Vegas situation have occurred in Israel %HESITATION it's it's hard it's I doubt it I mean it's it's some they would have been there a lot more security conscious also a much smaller country they have left forums %HESITATION last things that we're we're very vulnerable on that that's because we are an open society where democracy we're we're free people and and we're supposed to be able to say what you wanna say and basically do what we want to do as long as it's you know it's not against the law so %HESITATION it's you know it's very difficult to defend the United States %HESITATION from someone doing what the solidarity in in Las Vegas a over the weekend okay so many but your hardened every single %HESITATION got a high school football game around the country you know just and the thousands of them can you pardon every school and and and if you go through this process of hardening every ball park admission put security everywhere %HESITATION I guarantee you that it was it when you get the job done we probably never will get it if you do get a job done you wouldn't have been a free and open liberal democracy well you know that's one of the reasons why I support the second amendment and you know concealed carry for people because you know if this site not job had been on the ground %HESITATION it's conceivable that the some off duty put police officers who were at that concert one of one died for sure are they might've been able to stop the guy it is possible people do get stopped from doing things but this this particular tactic is it would be very very hard to to deal with them in in less you could actually get a site on the guy and that's really the only person is going to do that is a highly trained sniper and and %HESITATION since there was no warning you can't get a person to the other place and time no I guess you'd see the gunshot flashes if you look up %HESITATION when he was doing this but but you're right it would have been very difficult to stop him or slow him to but since nine eleven look what what has happened in looking at the places we've gone we're still in Afghanistan were still in Iraq it just why are we there it's it's so it just seems to me William that we want to be there well you know first of all it's a policy decision to be there and %HESITATION I think that the other thing that happens is once once one person commits a two very very hard port act right since we're for a couple reasons one includes the poor people who are there that we went in to support if we leave there's gonna be genocide in those countries yeah I won't think of it this way there was no ISIS before the United States broke security system that Saddam had replaced slot Saddam was allows and a murderer in and everything else but the fact of matter is that he kept people under control of the country and %HESITATION if we had never gone and we would have had that problem now interestingly enough so we went in because %HESITATION the intelligence community allowed the %HESITATION bush administration to believe that there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and of course now we know there weren't and in fact we knew at the time but %HESITATION but once you're in there then we're in there sort of perpetually yeah but there's another philosophical point and that is that %HESITATION the %HESITATION %HESITATION after nine eleven we just decided that this could never ever happen again and so we began to sort of build up our resources to counter terrorism and we made foreign policy instrument of college because of terrorism that sounds a little strange but that's what's animating it today were afraid to walk out because we think isis would get the upper hand we have a terrorist medicine in our it come to our country %HESITATION I don't think that's true I think we've I think that there is a whole lot %HESITATION there are a whole lot of politicians and other elected representatives of the intelligence community that really play on the fear of terrorism now that we got a little bit funny %HESITATION if you exclude the loan will psychopaths right like the terrible snag big like you that's right yeah then the United States has very little tear and the other thing to know is the word terrorism remains pretty much undefined it's it's allusive we could say okayed there's there's been like four hundred definitions of it but here's here's one that I would say it's defined as a non state violence no not a country %HESITATION but with a political motivation but if you take that particular view then you have to say that you know George Washington and Menachem Begin of Israel and Vendela of Algeria were all terrorists because they blew things up in the he I used a terrorist tactics they didn't they used asymmetrical warfare and all three of these men became heads of state and so as it turned out victors in conflicts tend to write the history and they decide who is and who knows who is not a terrorist %HESITATION in the U. S. terrorism has been blown all out of perspective night and this is not to minimize nine eleven nine eleven was the worst terrorist event in his least that were aware %HESITATION but following nine eleven %HESITATION while the U. S. constructed of surveillance security state we spend hundreds of billions of dollars there was almost no terrorism in fact the number of terrorist acts in the United States to steadily declined as I mentioned earlier %HESITATION and the past decade the yearly totals have been as low as zero %HESITATION and as high as ten terrorist attacks don't you compare that to gun violence this year alone there have been about ten thousand deaths we would not call a terrorist attack not I'm Michael in the terrorist attack but the FBI is not calling them terrorist attacks when a three year old plays so major responsibilities we got around the three year old plays with or somebody picks up %HESITATION %HESITATION seven eleven and %HESITATION clerk gets killed or you know or perform or anything but there are many many their ten thousand gun deaths to date this year and %HESITATION there probably have been only about three or four terrorist events I think I can't think of a no no you're absolutely right with her so why do we have to spend all this money except that it's it's politicians who are dishonest and they're telling the people we have to have all this money for these things we have to have all these agencies we have to build up our counter terrorism we have to engage yourself with these foreign wars and that I don't think they're saying it because it's true when they say because they want to get elected well if if we cut back to pre nine eleven that hundred and twenty billion dollars you quoted would be what well thirty maybe thirty and would we still be secure I yeah Pete just by the security we are today I believe that okay %HESITATION it's you know it's the is that every time we do something to counter terrorism we have to be careful that is not an equal and opposite reaction so like for instance we you could say we went into Iraq counterterrorism or once we were there we are countering terrorism we have to fight al Qaeda after Iraq's which was a terrible organization teamed up with forces in a you know against American forces of the %HESITATION but what what what you're in Iraq %HESITATION venue just stock that but it so well and we are stuck yeah we aren't we work were quite clearly stuck there but but but we continue to say we we need to build up our counterterrorism defenses now what happened in Iraq the final results not in yet and may not be in for many years the fact of matter is %HESITATION that %HESITATION ISIS Hey came to power and ISIS is a terrorist group a committed all kinds of atrocities and so the United States felt we had now wipeout prices so we're continuing the war there continue to go after them no as is people get killed their relatives and friends are gonna start going after American so in my view there is sort of our a terror counterterrorism Carol dynamic I would say that terrorism would be almost nonexistent if we but out of other countries yeah well you know Monday morning quarterbacking is is really easy but think about it this way toward suppose if instead of invading Iraq back in two thousand three we had him in dead %HESITATION gone after known terrorists and killed as many as we could you put all of our energy into that which which might have been a better idea yeah we might have killed a thousand terror and it would have been cheaper to yeah and then we could said to the world okay we're done with don't mess with the United States right because if you do pop up as a terrorist we're gonna come to take you out welcome take yeah but now we've got this kind of global mission where we got both the %HESITATION Pentagon and the CIA operating drones sometimes independently going into a half dozen countries to take out terrorists I mean bin laden's number two guy William buzz our here he he's still alive somewhere I don't know how how and what can we go get this guy I I I just don't know how it's possible we can't find him he's probably living in a cave you know someplace in Afghanistan southern guy decisis leader Baghdatis that they thought was killed the Russians thought they got him he did apparently he popped up again you don't find these people you know his story at all it it's it's kind interesting he he was a cleric at a university %HESITATION he was a very devout religious person who %HESITATION his idea and life was to study the Islamic texts for the rest of his life and maybe it's doable preaching well he was rounded up with a whole bunch of people by %HESITATION U. S. troops and sent into into which a lot of this terrible jails that we had in a rack yeah and he was there for a couple years worry got connected up with all kinds of terrorists all kinds of really bad people and then he went out the trade dislocation in the and %HESITATION he actually first confronted al Qaeda and Iraq and then overcame it %HESITATION but he was an officer in that for awhile and then he founded isis and of course from there on it we know what happened to it youth group was a movement and now it's being battered down again but I have a feeling something else will arise you know I'll probably probably it would happen OKW well I think ill tighter with the United States been very successful in destroying most of al Qaeda %HESITATION now the people that that work to confide all kind of really need al Qaeda they need it because now they got all these are least tens of billions of dollars to spend and you know kind of sure somebody's got to be there to spend it on or against yeah and %HESITATION I think that the occult hide it has %HESITATION it is more of a kind of slow movement now and it's not well organized and it decapitated %HESITATION its funds are gone it's %HESITATION it it's got a lot of problems in high school expected all kind will not be a problem in the future but there will always be as long as we maintain a military presence abroad hunting down terrorists there always be new terrorist group say no we're not to let them get away with this %HESITATION their you know their they're from the west they don't understand our culture and so we're going to going to get your headline of course of the of the books of the year title democracy betrayed are you know gives you the impression that democracy has been betrayed yeah well what is it more go ahead one overhead I use it worthwhile to give up some of these freedoms for the feeling of safety I was gonna say the illusion of safety well it is the illusion of %HESITATION and you know the old hook famous quote I to get by Benjamin Franklin about someone who would who would you give up the rights their rights and freedoms that deserve neither security Norse a safety nor freedom %HESITATION and and and and I think it sort of goes that way of look what I'm well could you remind me of your question I'm sorry we went up and all of the place well you know we were talking about your title democracy betrayed her in the end of two GB that gives you the illusion that that we we have an illusion of safety we have an illusion of safety we also increasingly have an illusion of freedom and democracy because we have a large group in our government now of hundreds of thousands of of employees in fact you know there are one point five million people in the US government with top secret security clearance they got to think about that for a minute easy they could be contractors they could be government employees right one point five million with top secret so what that means is the government must be hiring people who fit that description a lot of security a lot of security agents and as these numbers grow %HESITATION it becomes very difficult to have our our freedoms and not change into a much more authoritarian kind of state and that's why I actually I wrote the books because I became concerned that if things keep going the way they're going there will be a conversion and the nature of our our democracy and so I I thought that we are betraying democracy in order to get a little temporary security but in fact we're not going to get that one well let me ask you this if a guy he's in his house and he's on the internet looking at the procedures to make a bomb and surveillance sees this and they find out and they go all right this guy hears his house he's looking at bomb making material is it a good thing to invade that guy's privacy to get him before he does something well you gotta ask who who's looking at these things she offered for ten years I taught a a course on terrorism and counterterrorism at the university level in my students at all go ahead find out about these things %HESITATION that's how I learned that there were were %HESITATION %HESITATION bomb manuals on the internet %HESITATION my students starting showing them told yeah they're everywhere and and I said to him Hey Hey you know listen up probably not a good idea for you guys go researching there and they figure but but but we can research and we want I said yeah OK I don't think that I think too many people are interested in this topic and they certainly would have gotten me long ago I've I've I've %HESITATION probably Google's almost everything you can to has anything terrorism and counterterrorism and methods of of %HESITATION about bomb making all kinds of what you don't know if they checked you while they probably said well this guy's a college professor or he does this and that he's not gonna make a bomb and that's the interesting thing is you don't know but as the Madonna or not but you can be pretty sure that somebody is looking at Jen up I was just make one other point here it might might be might be helpful in that instant this growth of the whole security sector of our of our state and our economy would not have been possible without the information technology revolution and that revolution which probably seems pretty blase too to young people well for guys like you and me we've seen the revolution right that's right I mean I mean %HESITATION you you know I I am I am an apple iPhone seven in %HESITATION I can do many things too that's just unbelievable I remember when I grew up as as a boy out we had one phone in the kitchen well I am telling you that the smartphone is your hand held computer and it has made life so much easier in so many different ways it certainly has but the same technology that goes into peace building the algorithms software and and does this semiconductors the hardware for your cell phone that same technology it's a dual use in character it it can be used to record everything if people are doing so if you you know in this country people are are innocent till proven guilty but there are lots and lots of agencies investigate literally hundreds of thousands of people now let me explain a little little dancer hold on for one second we'll get right into that we're already at the top of the hour William and we're gonna come back and talk more with you about your work democracy betrayed will also take some phone calls with you right here on coast to coast AM |||||||||| well come welcome to everyone listening all around the world all across the United States we are coming to you live from the knowledge is seeker recharge center right here in Los Angeles California which is the coast to coast AM studios sitting in for George nor tonight I am your host Jimmy church and tonight filmmaker and director Damon team Barry is my guess now Damon has just finished the knowledge of the forever time invitation number eight the last in his film series by the way knowledge of the forever time and I I like the most of you well I'm on a quest I'm on a journey and I'm trying to put all of the pieces together every day I'm searching for answers into literally everything you know I'm looking to find out who built the great pyramid of Egypt and why lost history ancient civilizations contact with the tea Antarctica the black knight satellite sacred geometry crop circles ancient mythology symbolism who is really running the world you know and what do they really know and what is missing in the textbooks today you know that we teach our children all of it I am constantly constantly going down the rabbit hole I study everything and just when I thought that I'd exhausted all of the resources I'll find something new and it'll continue to open my mind to those fresh so thoughts those things and I'm always looking for that new perspective and that's what happen to me a couple of years ago when I found a mint tea berry and I spent our whole day binging on his series I did I really did the knowledge of the forever time and sure you know the familiar things for their you know the great pyramid ET cave paintings all of that but the Damon has a way of connecting the dots in a way that I hadn't heard before he was presenting a question with an answer throughout each of the film series and you know the thing is it was a way that it just made me think was it subtle no it was not refreshing absolutely and I am okay when I'm presented with information or theories that go against what I've learned to read it's the only way that you know I can find a way to move forward I'm never comfortable I'm never complacent I'm looking for that challenge and when you know that challenge happens and I find myself you know forced into wiggling my seat just a little bit you know a little uncomfortable you know when I have to pause to adjust my paradigm I know at that point that I found something different and it's always a good day for me when that happens like that day I found Damon tea berry two years ago so turn down the lights you get ready for about to have another great night here on coast to coast and maybe we can talk Damien into our help me out take some phone calls a little bit later you can follow me right now on Twitter at J. church radio you know the drill Twitter is always live to my left in any questions or comments you can post them right there and maybe just maybe if it's good your tweet will get read on the air as always enjoy the bumper music tonight I really put down through his paces and yes there is a little bit of a theme you'll figure it out it's pretty easy but I would still love to see your comments later we're gonna open up the phones why because it's another Friday night on coast to coast filling in for George nori I'm host Jimmy church and I'll be right back with my guest Damon T. bury this is coast to coast AM welcome back to coast to coast AM army host Jimmy church sitting for George nori tonight Friday night open lines I guess tonight is David T. Barry and I just wanted to let everybody know that how George took the night off and right before show time tonight guy he texted me and wanted me to make sure that I said hi to everybody form but it but you know what I think is feeling a little guilty he took the night off right you know how it is you call in sick to your boss you take the night off and then or the day off and then like you know I think I could have gone into work today so that's what good is Georgia wishing he was here but you've gotten me tonight open lines and my guess tonight is David T. Barry and he's an American film director screenwriter producer best known for writing and directing the knowledge of the forever time it's a documentary film series that as completely re written the history of mankind and it explores reveals ancient knowledge in a way that no one has done before David began his professional career as a radio broadcaster and then accepted a position with the Walt Disney company where he would learn the art of script writing in movie making well while visiting the apparent it's in Giza right he experienced a powerful transformation and I've talked about this on the year before with Damon I if we can tonight baby will revisit the story but it was extraordinary what happened so he comes back to the states decides to start writing we created the film series the knowledge of the forever time and it's one through eight each episode is called an invitation each invitation is an infinite invitation to a new age of man a new age of earth and the age of enlightenment now you can check out the film series completely for free you can do it on Amazon prime you can do it on you too can go to Damon's you tube channel it's everywhere and that's the beauty of this film series it's out there for everybody to go and get the knowledge tonight we're going to discuss the completion of the series and how was it is how it seriously has transformed him and what the message means to all of humanity and I would like to welcome back to coast to coast my good friend Damen tea berry Damon good evening good evening Jimmy thank you so much for having me again I do appreciate it you've got the pipes my man and welcome back to coast to coast but not like yours I'm working on now what you know what its practice lot of late nights which you have to do is work till four AM everyday and you know it just comes naturally %HESITATION I would like to read I Damon I am sorry if I could jump out I actually because were so limited on time tonight we've got a lot of stuff to discuss I want to jump straight into it if you don't mind you've got eight films now in the can is there another one in there well to be honest with you after what I have gone through and creating this final film I've put all of any idea of creating another one on it it's been complete hell are trying to create the last invitation which was number eight because of whatever forces that there are %HESITATION they came on one hundred percent so there's surveillance there it's breaking in they're stealing scripts they're stealing you know %HESITATION video creations Photoshop creations title music coming furk trying to create number eight the last one was the hardest one I've ever had to do because there it would literally is another side to %HESITATION theft and you know the one thing that's really interesting is when you hear stories about you know Sony addict company Sony this people stealing their movies and stealing them from televisions just shows and H. B. O. you think it has to be something that someone's doing but there really are criminals of the way that they can get your now is so amazing that they can literally steal anything that you make on a computer anything that you can create that uses a computer they have the ability to take it so number eight was it was it was unbelievable because every time I would create two weeks worth of work I would come back it would be completely gone well what I tell us what we got yet what that tells me is your messages on point and you're saying something that is making some actors out there very uncomfortable do you think that what is what is going on are they trying to silence you it is clearly what they're trying to do is silence me from from having anyone to watch this film I'm the one thing that they do is they're so good at taking what you have that I don't do anything on Facebook I don't do anything online I don't even answer people who write to me on YouTube because they have an ability to attack you that way as well anyway any place where I'm on it in any way they will show up and wait for example that is how they do it though you'll create so two out of it %HESITATION thirty minutes worth the work and you'll come back to the day I mean the next day and everything missing you go on YouTube and somebody will write you a message and say Hey you know I just saw yourselves it really great it was like when I watched it thirty minutes was missing and then they'll put LOL Libyan so what you're saying is they would go in erase your hard drive steal your material watch it and then turn around and notify you in social media that they are watching your film ha ha ha exactly exactly so it's it's it's it's it's another but I mean the thing that's really amazing about what happens is they have the ability to go now might help my home security only have a security alarm that cameras inside everything they have the ability to turn off your alarm they have the ability to turn off any home alarm they have the ability to turn off any cameras you have in your house and your house because you if your cameras are tied to wifi anyway if you can look at your house to your cell phone or watch it on your computer they can turn that off anytime they want and so every day that I would awaken I go into my studio and all my files to be going my thumb drives to be gone live with whatever film that I was working on completely gone I go to the security tapes right around two thirty to three o'clock everything's missing completely deleted so I go to the alarm the alarm is still on so I don't know how they do it but they're able to get through the alarm and %HESITATION take everything from you and you have no proof even on videotape it literally can turn it off and I found out from a hacker anything that has a wifi signal is vulnerable because once they get into the wifi signal they see which you see they know your passwords and they can take anything they want so this becomes a struggle to it to complete this film this was the hardest film to complete but I've ever worked on it after doing it and I never want to do it again but there was something else that was interesting that happened and it it kind of was a really unsettling %HESITATION I'm going to create a video and collected audio I kept thinking I was going crazy I said I know I put this film here I know I put this click here I don't like the script here and it's gone so I started realizing someone stealing from the elected when I started realizing it when I would leave even though I was setting a home alarm I would begin recording with an audio recording I just put audio recorder in the hallway house is empty you leave the house you're turning on a recorder turning on recorder because I knew someone was getting in and I just know how responsible but this one was strange %HESITATION all one instance I leave the house I can when I come back to listen to the recording you can hear the alarm going off you hear the alarm army you can hear the garage closing at early and then suddenly you hear footsteps your movement in the house you hear movement and then the next thing you hear is my computer system starting up so they have the ability to be in your home it while you're in your home and you still can't kind of all went to the police department they say they haven't on a device that allows you to see who's in a house okay using this device they always know which room you're in so if you're looking for them they're always able to stay one step ahead of you but they went to the computer they took everything but what was interesting is on one on three three three occasions when I set the alarm and I went back to listen to the audio there was a weird stoned like stones grinding sound and then there was no old weird vibration type of sound then you hear some type of digital keypad being pressed then you get my computer turned on again then the water there he stayed near the moving around her taking files right before I get back you hear this goal line being concrete sound and it sounds like if somebody was going to be honest with you it sound like you know one of the UFO sounds witty the flying saucer comes and it's like a wound vibration kind of style right it was that kind of sound and soon as you hear that sound it's quite next thing you hear is the garage opening and me walking through the door so the one thing when I'm trying to explain it to people because they find it just can't be this bad so my next project will be used to create an audio of what went on in making number eight because it was the we are just scariest time that I've ever been alive to know that no matter how secure you believe your house is someone has the ability to comment whenever they feel like I would like to hear that tape I would like to hear that recording that's you know that's a complete violation of everything and it makes life completely uneasy how did you how did you sleep how does how did your family get through this but no one no one is the sad part about it you go to the police you tell the police what happening they think it's a made up story because even they think it's impossible right how can somebody do this right how can somebody do this on this level and of course you know because I'm making the films free to the public they're thinking why would somebody do this to you if they're absolutely free so that that became the case so what they told me to do was get as much evidence you can't and then we can see if we can put together a case so that's all I've been doing is building evidence and like I said if you hear what's happening in the home if it's completely amazing to know that someone can be in your home while you're in Iraq in your home and you will you don't know if they have the ability to be in the in the in the in the other room that urine they know where you are in the house so when you start searching room to room which I've done several times you won't find anything because they're always a step ahead of invitations one through seven are you know excellent I've I've watched them many many times in in sequence in order but does this make invitation number eight the most important film what you've ever made because of the struggle yes it does I mean if this film was it was like something on a movie ferry was it was you ever see that the that the movie where the guy trying to get away in the government's after a foreign agent draft crewmen crooks are after it was exactly like that it was the hardest movie to get made because %HESITATION I couldn't even put it up on on given away for free because every movie that I created on my eyes on my computer they were deleted or they would steal it so I went made an agreement with U. F. O. T. V. they would distribute the film on Amazon prime right but when I went to drop the film off because the other guy only deals with that exist only people they trust so I crop bill Moffitt FedEx there's two guys sitting in a car I actually I'm gonna cut you off the reason why this story is too important we're talking about men in black now everybody we're gonna save that for after the break I want that %HESITATION completely uninterrupted but let me out so I am gonna cut shocked him to apologize but let me ask you this as we go into the break you have heard the stories about interruption technical difficulties the route through the gonna make your life rough they're not gonna like what you're saying all of these warnings you've heard about throughout the UFO community forever but now what do you say to those people that gave you those warnings I didn't believe you and I I I I it is the worst decision of my life not to believe you because everything that anyone has ever told me people will come to your house they'll steal your product build confiscated a governmental take it that the monitoring you there so they'll you will stop you from doing what you need to do all of that happened and I I am completely humbled by the experience because I never thought any of that would actually be true you said to me up privately I'm just gonna make it public right now for four million listeners you said to me privately said Jimmy I don't know how you deal with this and I turned right back Connie and I said well Damon %HESITATION welcome to the club how does it make you feel now how do you think it's real and your answer was I remember that conversation yes yes and if the thing is well for me which it but is most important here is you're a veteran you've been in the entertainment industry for a long time on all aspects of it from production to hose to to I'd narrator voiceover writer eve done every facet of it have you ever had interference run at you in any environment never even worse than that ice to arm work for the government as a liaison media liaison and with the government you have to have a secret security clearance you have to be secret you had to be able to handle a classified information secure of secure information and even with that clearance and even with the responsibility that I had I never received any kind of surveillance because of covert activity any kind of targeting like this in just creating the spell and this this man in black aspect of it which is which is very real and we talk about it an awful lot but it's another thing for somebody like you who is a filmmaker producer hosted a professional in the industry to start experiencing this but you've seen the movies will Smith's Amanda blackened but all of these reports but here you are dealing with it %HESITATION that how do you respond to that now when somebody brings up the men in black well you know when when when you hear the stories of men in black and this is the way I was before this happened me it was a cute little story a funny story something that people who don't have it all together say people who want wrapped tight they believe in this stuff it's not really couldn't possibly be you know what number benefits like a comedy so I'm thinking that you know it's just a movie it's it's folklore its people's ideas that couldn't possibly be true and it is completely true there are governments they're involved in your own government United States there are certain things they don't want published certain things they don't want said in certain things they don't want known and one of the things that people kept saying when every time I try to drop this package off an appendix somebody would stand at the door either to block me or someone would interrupt me acting like they're having a conversation with that really detaining and so the first thing that someone would say when I would leave as they would say trees burn right there this story will be complete right after the break my guess Damon T. bury this men in black episode is extraordinary this is coast to coast AM mom goes to my church heading for George nori on a Friday night I'll be right back no right sit in for George nori tonight took the night off now I played that song I know Damon right now is listening and is laughing I played that for him how appropriate right I don't care anymore now out a couple of things really quick our trivia contest the question tonight's question is recent gas Robert Gleason suggested a way out of the conflict with North Korea and it would be too I got four choices a stage a coup B. strike first see not paint them into a corner D.

Barry and his series the knowledge of the forever time now this series is now complete there's eight films you can check it out on Amazon prime you can go to you too can go to Damon's %HESITATION YouTube channel all of that is over a co so just a you can click on it there are go access these films completely for free and that's always been his goal is it to supply the knowledge and connect these dots while he finished the film and tried to find out if he had been getting broken into things stolen his computer lost control of things as hard drives are getting erased inside his house outside of his house remotely it was a long process to get %HESITATION imitation number eight finish but after he did then the man in black show up it's an incredible story so Damon tell me how did you how did you recognize what was going on did they do a couple of drive bys first we seen a car up the street you know that kind of thing it it's it's worse than that I mean I I it's it's always where ever you were going there was always a car that was right next to you but pulled up right next to you no one would get out the tent was always darker than what they allow on the street and at some point we would walk in a store and they use other people than other people you don't know it for example you'd walk into a store and you might be caught like Best Buy I'm trying to figure out how to get around so try to get some security right %HESITATION someone would walk up who would beat right next to me and he would be too looking like he's browsing but he'd be on a cell phone and the cellphone the camera would be pointing you towards you and he's act like he's having a conversation but he's literally just filming you making sure where British sending the film to knows where you are leave that store you walk outside there's another person standing outside he's got a cell phone too is pointing his he's acting like he's walking past you but he stops just long enough to get you a full view of the picture you get in your car when you drive away there's another because it's following you you don't know for sure if the following you or if you're being paranoid you get to where you're going you get out of your car that car pulls right behind you and sits there the problem that I knew what it was real was when I tried to get the film published on YouTube or Amazon prime Everytime I try to get it published they would stop my computers they would burn out the computer it would erase my hard drive only way to get this film out was to go to you UFO TV and have them distributed through our Amazon prime I take the video down to fed ex there sitting at the store waiting for standing in front of the door sometimes I go to different bed exit be sitting in the car in front of the door letting me know this is a note you will not send this film out so the one thing that I realized was no matter where I went they was there everywhere I went they were already there which means you know they have a tracking device in my car or they were tracking my phone but either way they knew my whereabouts at all times and there are you single but let me let me let me jump in real quick them if you don't mind are you suggesting that you were going to multiple fed ex locations in one day and then we were staying one step ahead of you they knew where they were going they're always ahead of me dot com I did something they were always ahead of me so it is in mime in my estimation logic they either have a tracking device on the car or the track in the phone so no matter where I was big or I would be at one time I took a a different phone that I had then I drove to a place that I didn't only number there to make the deal with UFO TV so I'm standing behind a seven eleven behind it alleyway in the street suddenly three cars pull up and they just stand up acting like they're walking around but who walks a seven eleven to go to an alley so the whole thing was they were letting me know we're watching you we're not allowed to film to be disseminated people will not be able to watch this film that was the whole goal so will because they knew I had to go to FedEx the guy has an account there he had to have it all good night go because a hundred sixty dollars so I said I called them up and I said Hey you know I'm going to try to get this thing to you I will go to the UPS store %HESITATION in about and in our albeit the UPS store on grand street and I'm just gonna go ahead and see if they can send it I'll just pay for it he's a great I got in the car heading towards UPS stopped short went to the U. S. P. S. the United States postal service ran in drop it off with them that was the only way they got it because I knew that if they were monitoring my phones they would go to UPS if that would be my location but I stopped halfway through it went to the United States postal service drop it off there that's the only way you got it so they they went to the UPS on grand outdoor yet but I think for me while yeah Hon now when somebody is listening to this out there yeah of course they're going to jump ahead you said it you know sounds like demons be little bit paranoid right %HESITATION I thought I knew you were being paranoid right see this is the thing you don't want to go crazy you know you don't want to step over the edge into the darkness you need to make sure that you've got your senses and your faculties about you how did you do that how did you prove to yourself that you warrant you know going nuts the if I didn't record it I would have believed that everything was in my head it was just me being paranoid it was me just by having an active imagination if I did not record it I would believe it I was just completely gone but the recordings corroborate everything that I'm saying to you everything that I found all that was the one thing they couldn't do and there was another thing I did that they had the ability to do %HESITATION I would buy spy cams online spy cams nanny cams and I put one they have some that you can stick in a socket that looks like a %HESITATION a battery charger for your phone yep pick in the socket got a camera on it about another one that ink pen but you can just lay it down it records video motion detectors %HESITATION abroad %HESITATION again the cameras and every time I went in to turn on any one of those devices to find out what happened while I was gone they would work none of so either they had cameras inside the house that knew where each other more or they have the ability to know if there's any kind of devices that tact or have electricity but every device that I plugged in to try to look at it and see what happened left home while I was gone none of them would work so without the audio I would have never believed it was possible and like I said the next film but I will pay if I get the chance is just to post the audio the making of number eight strange things and just have you can hear the audio with what was happening just tell me I can narrate yeah okay like yours yet now anymore Damon was it worth it %HESITATION I don't know I really don't know to be honest with you when I made numbers one through seven %HESITATION their whole goal is to enlighten to to reveal to humanity what what these ancient peoples are saying what these alien peoples are saying what the goal is of mankind and number eight is really the crescendo it's the one that pulled everything together it's the big story it's the one that has the biggest things that if it tells you about this the Stargate where it is tells you about crop circles why they appear tell you about the Nazca lines what it really actually means tells about the real meaning of the pyramid that it tells you about the Voynich manuscript all of these things I think that mankind has never understood and we never have a valid explanation for that and we have several people with theories but no one actually explains it and these things explained that in there something about this topic that they didn't want America or the world to see and I couldn't figure out what it was beget yelling trader I mean treason everywhere I went what I'm trying to drop it off treason it's treason and I I couldn't put it together and watching the film the only thing I can think it's it's has to be about the Stargate that's the only thing that I can think of but it could be something else that could be the Voynich manuscript but they don't want each the public to see this film and they also have a campaign to make sure no one sees it if you go on Amazon prime and just look at the reviews most people who see the film give the five star with you but then there's a whole cruelest people that are saying it's a one star film it's terrible on its racial it's ugly it's they just have all these negative things to make people that you know because most people read reviews before it watch yourself that's right so if you read these reviews from all these people giving it one star you would say I'm not gonna watch this movie it's terrible and they really have an army because it's one after another they told me on you too we will destroy yourself we'll make sure no one watches your fell and when they told me that the next day it's like an army everyday every hour somebody put one star up there or writing some kind of negative reviews but the good thing is we have viewers that watched the film that will answer them and say Hey I want you to our opponents say it's one star hate is revealing them the knowledge of the Nazca lines we have until the end of a thousand years how that only work one star so people are answering these people but the whole goal is every time I put that one star out it brings the star rating lower and lower and lower which makes it more readily available to someone to walk away from it so either way they're doing everything they can to make sure that people don't watch this film I wanted to ask you one of the points that I've always made %HESITATION when I when I speak about you is you have the ability the question presented the question giving the answer is one thing but you have been able to whether it's lost history or or Egypt or ancient civil E. T. Antar together with your sacred geometry crop circles cave paintings you have been able to instead of focusing on one subject to get all of these out there at the same time and connect the dots between them for an effective presentation but this is different from anybody else in any other researcher in the past how did you how did you what clicked dammit what click that enabled you to do it this way well I I have to tell you I used to love this dismantle Carl Sagan now he is to have filmed about space %HESITATION way back when he was but Neil degrasse Tyson was there Mitchell kaku is today I mean it was just the man for science and he had these great wonderful films about space about planet but there's one thing he always did he would see would say what is this is this way I wonder if this is another show that I would watch was science channel %HESITATION die a documentary on science and math science and the one thing that they do what they tell you about space it's always a wonder what is what could be and then another show I always like with ancient aliens engine aliens was a show that is really talking about aliens talk about UFO's and I liked the show because it it has so much information about these different places but Everest documentary that I've ever seen it never answers the question every documentary is always about what yes what could it be no one knows the answer no ones knows why and after I would walk several engine aliens of series television shows there were a lot of things that they were presenting that I knew the answer to I don't know how I just knew the answer and I would do the research in their IT research would confirm that this is the answer so I wanted to make a documentary that didn't just leave you with questions like every documentary does I want to leave you with answers and the more that you go deeper into the subject of the entrance and what they were saying and what you are closer saying that what is really interesting they all have the exact same message and the message truly is for mankind there's a reason UFOs are always appearing over the world and it's not just to say Hey we're here it's to say Hey wake up there's a time coming for all of us to communicate and they've already begun the communication right now and every case painter every pyramid builder every hieroglyphics lighter news this and they knew it four thousand years ago and we are the only ones on the earth with all our technology who thinks it's it's crazy it's just made up it's just savages they did know what they were talking about and it's it's amazing because they're really telling us something is about to happen on this earth and that's why the US those are appearing where do you keep your data now is it out of your house is it secret away because I can imagine that some of this pressure and some of this interference as being run on you is maybe that you're in possession of some some information that maybe you're not aware of maybe you are but maybe that's it what do you think I think that you are one hundred percent correct now the one thing that I took away from people saying trees and what I'm trying to get this film out the film it's telling you things that the world doesn't know and this is not a grandiose statement this is not an arrogant statement this is just a fact there are things that that the world doesn't know that if the world did not waste it would give a disadvantage to the United States for example there are stargates on our planet there is %HESITATION some of a machine that allows us to go to different parts however we only have one option of the Stargate being in our well there are other countries that have three and four different options so because they will know that that's a possibility it gives them a defensive advantage the other thing is we're talking about the Voynich manuscript for everyone who doesn't know what the quench manuscript is is a six hundred year old manuscript that no one has ever has ever been able to crack the best is the best knowledge that we have all that are ten words after six hundred years it's always cracked if ten words but that Voynich manuscript when you open it it is the most devastating knowledge of all and to know it is devastating also crop circles are in the film and to understand why they're created this crop circles every crop circle that they are creating is literally a form of intervention they're talking to us they're showing us things they're giving us information they're giving us a knowledge and they're really educating us but we're thinking it's just beautiful patterns in the field but it's not all of it contains it really high technological information for example one of the crop circles they left tell us about how the stars and how the planet's really moon and it really turns everything that Einstein ever taught about the general theory of relativity it throws it in the trash because it means everything that we're learning is wrong and so when you see this knowledge and you understand what it says it's the greatest evidence that this is alien intelligence and that they are speaking to us more than anything else crop circles have more validity than anything else I've ever seen because the knowledge is so big that you may feel a human being couldn't do it that big so I think that look giving that knowledge to the world would probably give another country of superior advantage if they act on a first our guest tonight is day men T.

he won cy fi's reality competition show ghost hunters academy earning a coveted spot on the network's hit original series ghost hunters where he met and first teamed up with his investigation partner Amy Bruni any in Adam welcome to coast to coast AM how are you Kurt thing very good thank you for having us I want to ask you first any you were raised in a haunted house tell me about these ghosts with whom you shared your childhood home did they make for good housemates oh yeah I would like to say yes black record baby not and it's funny because I think that my stories pretty familiar to a lot of paranormal investigators because I think a lot of us started out having experiences children %HESITATION but yeah I grew up with house is just a very typical nineteen forties bungalow in Alameda California and %HESITATION the ghosts there were very active we had thing we want to work all the time doors opening and closing and I saw a full blooded apparition %HESITATION we actually had a family of even over the dinner party at our house because they saw something and they never came except circle of this is what I I was raised around and you would do your your your your parents as you point out are were very sort of open to this whole idea so you weren't when they did you were trained or you were taught not to fear them but I mean as a child I that I would imagine that's easier said than done while I think as a kid were set and kids were so impressionable and we look to our parents for everything and you know my parents you know he's just died that goes were very normal and that they were just kind of a way of life and I still found it very interesting and that's when I started really studying spiritual aquarium innocence back in that the EDS and so I was watching shows like it search and then you're going to my local library and reading every almost Hans Holzer broker to get my hands on %HESITATION but my parents just always acted like it was a completely normal and fine and so that's that's something that we kind of %HESITATION say to families lean meat now is you know it's the it's the fear level that you have is what your kids are going to happen so it's important it's accurate confidence I in the face of your hunting because your kids will feel safer and have him tell me about this ghostly encounter that forever changed the %HESITATION trajectory of your life I'm I mean yeah very much set aside two enemies and I my first experience I had I've I was a kid and that you know like I woke up in the middle of the night and I heard a M. a dog scratching on the bathroom door and then walking into my room and then %HESITATION yeah I got to the TV and the TV was on of those old tube TV if someone turned off the kind of you had a glow to it for a minute and every time I got to the TV the sound excuse me got the TV the TV would glow and just repeated this %HESITATION over and over again and I did have a duck and I okay you buried the lead there I do have a dog and I I %HESITATION we I was very at you know for some reason I I wasn't terrified of it I was kind of wrapped up in the experience of it and that Yemen to the process you know maybe my aunt was saying over the night you know maybe the dog was in the house but I didn't see a dark haired NO %HESITATION and I %HESITATION said I released as set out loud go away leave me alone and stop simply stopped so I felt like I I had power over it you know and that I so I I never felt too afraid by it but that was the first the very first experience I ever had and I spent the rest of my formidable years %HESITATION you know I'm thinking about ghosts and being wrapped up in and what they are and how they exist and %HESITATION a trip to Gettysburg %HESITATION when I was much older and able to comprehend my surroundings and not influenced you know from an imagination a kid %HESITATION you know I wouldn't wandered off into a field and that after I go stand by myself and I heard gunshots and loud cannon fire and I saw things in the woods and I could not explain and you know I was old enough to know better as they say and I and I could not explain it could not get out of my mind for weeks afterwards and so that kind of propelled me and to really tackle what we're dealing with and that what it is we are actually experiencing from a scientific perspective but also from %HESITATION you know a spiritual perspectives and propelled me to create a team in and that does I guess a long story short where we are today in Hebrew the end a Adam Barry are with us from kindred spirits that airs Friday nights on TLC correct alright well let me at nine eight central alright season two I I wanted us your your from you grew up in muscle shoals AL yeah hi Adam did you ever visit popes tavern I'm I I didn't I I I muscle shoals I you know it's it's a it's a beautiful town very much in India the musical Graham I would say you know artists come out of there %HESITATION Cropper the legends legends exactly but not a lot of ghosts talking you know that especially %HESITATION in that in that region and I think you church %HESITATION plays a big role in everyone's life and that is you know we didn't they didn't talk about ghosts and spirits in the way that I talk about it today %HESITATION so that that at you know my my parents I might Bernice Harris I'm parents are really a militant say that it was a bad thing I mean they like you know scary movies and things like that but %HESITATION I think having a conversation with them or my grandmother at the time I think it would have been thrown to the wayside what would be ended to either if you but when when people have a ghost problem and they approach the two of you for I I they typically are they typically panicked or how would you describe your state of mind or emotional I might say I would say the time they're coming to our surprise at their wits end like they have %HESITATION David sport every option I usually where we come in they have in their %HESITATION you contacted their local church or they have had other paranormal teams come in or they've had people come in claiming to kind of cleanse the house are crossing over but things are still there and so they are just kind of in there over it and Hassan and you know these are usually family if you don't is it because they don't want to live with it but many of them feel as though they have some sort of connection to whatever it is in their home and don't become kind of an emotional thing it's gonna make sure they're doing the right thing %HESITATION into sometimes they're very conflicted sometimes they're desperate you know sometime their frantic and it is each case is different but I would say usually by the time we get there %HESITATION they are usually pretty desperate you know you like the last line of defense if if you can help them they're putting the for sale sign on the front I can't tell you how many times that's been the case so or you know we we have a case later on this year and where they as they had the house for sale I you know before we got there they were trying to sell it for a good six months idea because they were done so we we've got there even when it's beyond that how it I don't I don't know how the real estate laws work in the United States but I think up in candidates on the books if a place is haunted even though you know maybe the realtor doesn't believe it or whomever you have to disclose that is at the same in the United States up front fun fact I have a real estate license from Massachusetts I'm so I I would say in Massachusetts you don't have to tell them that someone has passed away or the house is said to be haunted and Leslie asked if they ask out loud verbally here and say Hey any history do you know any history of having hunted or anyone dying here if you know the answer to that question you have to answer it legally it's like a four year request if you don't ask the right question you don't get exactly protector any Bruni N. Andrew berry are out with this Adam bury my apologies and very end of the show is called kindred spirits and it airs Friday nights on TLC it's not so much a ghost hunting story you've described it as more of a ghost therapy I shall explain or are we have found over the years many people kind of describe it it's eerie that you cross things overturn or in the sense the light we kind of in our experience has found that if we go in with a very intensive type investigation into what could be actual trying to communicate with you guys he's doing that research to figure out who and why they're there %HESITATION no it's it's not an easy process per se but we decided we can figure out exactly why they're there that is usually what causes things to kind of slow down or he's altogether the activity usually stop and and so that's kind of the idea behind and we we obviously we have to deal with the families and sound %HESITATION and and be very respectful of their position what they're going through but then we also give the same respect and and %HESITATION NC overseas and you the same way and I think that's kind of what that is a part of you know we just %HESITATION what we you know we encourage other investigators units as well but we just leave that as people say go so people know that and so we just really try to %HESITATION and its people said where were gross therapist tried to talk to the ghost is so %HESITATION we are in helping them really aren't but %HESITATION eventually our main goal is just trying to assist them with whatever they need nowhere not good sorry go ahead and not just to add to it I mean we're not we're not going into a house saying Hey are you here can you knock and move stuff you know it's Hey are you here what do you need how can we help you how clean figure out why you're still here why are you still here is there a message you need to get across to someone %HESITATION you know a lot of these families %HESITATION you know I mean to they have a close connection and do these entities it's true because they feel like maybe it's a love one has passed but they're like why is my grandmother pushed me down the stairs you know that's a great question I was to come to is for those if if it is %HESITATION an ancestor or a you know a a close relative if they cared for you in your in in in life and they loved you in life why would they be tormenting and haunting you in death I mean that that is such a strong word I mean I I think it is does hunting mean the presence of the spirit just being around or is it or is dove hunting means something that's menacing so there's there's like what is the definition and I feel that if if something is just around and there is not necessarily menacing right so it that the entity could be just in a %HESITATION getting their attention because they built the house and you know a hundred and fifty years ago or they're connected to a murder that happened down the street and or you know if it happens to be a relative if they could be a checking maybe in season one we had a case where %HESITATION eh granddaughter was the only one that went and took care of her grandmother's tombstone and she did it I'm a you know on a weekly monthly basis was there all the time and cared about her her nana with which she was called and she had all of Hernandez pottery in her house and her nana happen to just be in her home as well watching over her and so it was a it was a win win situation however she was terrified because it was the first time she lived alone she didn't know I'm you know what is happening in the house and she thought it was menacing and it really wasn't it was just and her grandmother watching out for her American there think %HESITATION activity that we to us it's kind of normal day to day type activities to someone who you know not dealing with it as often as we do vaccines menacing you have things like footsteps our voices are our doors closing air or being touched those are kind of in those scary but that's not necessarily negative or menacing type activity that's that's true me at the lake you relate granny could be in the kitchen making some pecan pie because that's what she always did but to you you're not expecting that so that that ending it to be that way back she can helpers exactly and and so it's our it's our job and you know really to go in and find out who it is whether there and to give %HESITATION really closure and comfort to both sides of the veil if you well you know for the homeowners to understand this activity and why it's happening and for the entities to finally be wrecked you know %HESITATION recognized and %HESITATION acknowledged when we come back we're heading into a break I want to talk to you you kicked off season two with a visit to Lizzie Borden is how infamous that's probably the most heart I have a ghost in here someone just threw a pen across the room off-again to be like in the top ten hundred locations and I

AM six forty in the Bruneian Adam berry are with this from a kindred spirits Friday nights on TLC and I just kicked off season two I guess last month and the I think it was the year the premier and the debut episode of season two you went to %HESITATION Lizzie Borden's house in in Massachusetts %HESITATION so explain how it works because the format is you know you're dealing with families who have ghost problems but %HESITATION I mean you weren't meeting with Lizzie Borden's descendants were you well that we would have gotten out of the no we were actually helping a lot and employees there to help and so her grandparents were haunting her at the location and she has been told by many psychic medium who I came to those new courthouse steps with some reason her grandparents were there with her and so she doesn't have this kind of kept going on and finally she asked us to come in and kind of confirm this for her why she here why she their excuse me any why is why was this woman there is usually a long hair yeah she would trigger the tour guide issue one day Latin partner wasn't currently yes you do its work I and %HESITATION into just kind of wanted brought to light it's kind of interesting questionable of what happens to people who work everyday in interviews territory Asli haunted location %HESITATION but yeah it was actually a very emotional very powerful episode and %HESITATION you know we we did of course tried to contact the board and while we were there we were homeless trying to kind of that list there how little that wish it but trip but overall we were I mean I think you're the first person people who investigator Lizzie Borden house and who are looking for the board at least so that's it that's interesting you tried Wen list well mia at the ghost there but I've let me just park that for a second because I want to come back to this %HESITATION this woman was your name sue yeah yeah and so her she believed her grandparents had moved in they would they sort of followed her to work one day is that well now it was it was more like they were protecting her because she felt that people that work there things would happen he would get sick they would have unexpected deaths that have accidents %HESITATION she was afraid that the house or whatever was there was affecting %HESITATION the lives of those that work there and she was terrified %HESITATION by her experiences that she had in the house %HESITATION she would not sleep there overnight and as you I mean a they do night towers and sometimes if it's really late our or snowy outside if the weather is bad %HESITATION the tour guide stay in the house was she wouldn't do it she would go and sleep in her car in the middle of winter which became a hazard for her she was that terrified and so you know but these people were saying that her grandparents were in the house sort of protecting her %HESITATION and we were in listing the Borden's to be in a a go between really because the idea is peopled investigated that location for numerous years we have an idea and a sense that the Boredoms are there at some you know at the father is there for sure in my opinion and so it's like hi Andrew Borden can you please give a message to %HESITATION you know sous grandparents %HESITATION if you see them if they if they're here with us you know let them know that you know we we just want to confirm that there that they're round and Matt's how one well that's that's really that one of the things that we did and in that location I mean how often does that happen when you when you have a a family of of ghosts moving in and %HESITATION are they are they battling perhaps with other ghosts in the house well you know what battling could save it a stink %HESITATION I think they form kind of you know relationships I think they I think are conscious of each other and in Iraq in a way %HESITATION but eight it even exists I think it just depends on the circumstance if I think of any home where somebody is kind of the residents and the mountains when it's kind of a roommate situation all the discipline and it is going to depend on how they get along a you know as as humans so that that's how we look at our next I hadn't thought of it in that way I I I guess I always assumed that there may be %HESITATION sort of different dynamics but maybe that ghosts are living on a different sort of a different time planes so for example if you have a very old house you may have ghosts that lived there let's see here in England and it dates back to the fifteenth century so you may have a ghost that sort of live are repeating in that time timeline and then you may have ghosts who lived in the eighteenth century but I didn't think that their their paths crossed necessarily on the other side to eve disabuse me of that notion I I mean it it's potential if there is a potential there's a potential there for that to happen or someone who never lived in that house of property but on the land the thing that where you know they owned acres and acres of land and they're still kind of wondering the land because they owned all of those acres and now there's a bunch of houses on and so all the entire neighborhood has you know similar activity we pass it here every time we experience and and see something or a or learn something new I think were shocked by it because it changes the continuously changes our views and opinions on and and what works kind of dealing with %HESITATION and with suse and and ensues case ability board and we did confirm like we never really got any response from her grandparents until she was in there with us investigating without so indeed they were following her to the location and there's a bigger atoms for the episode but there's a bigger message happening and and the reason why are her family was kind of gathering around her %HESITATION it during for from with perfume me out months and months and there was something of a leading up to it which at you know and everyone can much deficit in and %HESITATION and and see what the end as but it that's this remarkable it's remarkable there is not you did not your typical lug the ghost hunting series at all you work with a psychic why shepherd one of our dearest friends and where were there any %HESITATION Hickey about who is going into people's homes just because %HESITATION in the world were written were actually very skeptical shook and %HESITATION and so there's just certain psychic medium that we have grown to try to %HESITATION and we use them as one of many tools in our arsenal and sugar on it shifted its one of our our tools like that but it didn't but his body and we we we brought him it a few times and that we get your civility courthouse and it was great actually because he was able to shed some things are right up axes for do you I give you both of you hold out the possibility that there aren't that these are not the spirits of the dearly departed but they that they in at least in some cases could be some sort of a trickster entity even a demon masquerading as a no great aunt Minerva I mean I know I've had people come to me that theory at %HESITATION I for us just because we've done this for so long is you know I think that if you will was not seen any evidence of that %HESITATION but I mean I think I am getting I think people have this natural tendency to be fearful of what they don't understand and they kind of start to put this kind of evil %HESITATION idea behind it but for us we just you just not seen that and I %HESITATION you know we have seen things that have turned out to be potentially negative in nature but for the most part we really do feel that these there are just people like us with some sort of you know nature are major message they're trying to get across or something to get done and we just don't want to discount them with some theory of like that in any of my favorite thing Amy says is that %HESITATION they could be just grumpy ghosts because if you're a jerk in real life what's to say an object when you're dead they could just be like they could just be mean and and mad about something in a right right and that could come off as %HESITATION negatives and and demonic right like a you know crazy uncle to news from Cleveland you know from the old Danny Thomas show %HESITATION in he's quick he's going to be just as crazy on the other side I guess a little rain but what do you know why why stop living the dream when your desk so how difficult when you when you encounter a %HESITATION you know that the black sheep of the family or whatever how difficult it is is it to get them you know to turn towards the light may I mean maybe they enjoy what they're doing maybe they enjoyed tormenting their their relatives I think you know I I think it's it's it we just do what we do best we listen we ask questions we try to understand we try to be sympathetic and we try to you know come at it with the knowledge and of of the the history of the location of who this person is and once we get a grasp on who we think it is a fine as much information about that person as we can so that we can approach them with a and a gentle positive that you know kind environment and I think you know that that that does help us and help says find out why they're there and what they need and again you know big the going to the light %HESITATION theory is it is it is a theory I mean we don't ever say okay now thank you very message go to the light %HESITATION because we don't know if that works good enough that can actually happen because they have intelligence they they can do what they want there of their own free will at that you know but in a different plane but we find that once they deliver that message and once we you know I'm make sure the family knows what's happening in whose people are they kind of go away on their own because their their work is done there they've been acknowledged and and and it it's their time as they say if you're not working at that logo had %HESITATION I was gonna ask you if you're not working with the psychic Alexei chip coffee how do the ghosts communicate with you he'd do you do like the flashlights %HESITATION experiment or how does that work I mean I think what I don't really think that we need a lot more than just that and we use a lot of parents that we use are digital voice recorder we love EVP just because you don't get electronic voice phenomena which is a very clear answer for us on any other types of evidence he inclined I think more than anything we want our research to correlate with are evident the kind of confirm things for us and %HESITATION that's really the big things that will get little bits and pieces of evidence and then we will share that with research and historical document whatever we can find that information you know put together is usually what we need in order to kind of figure out who and what is there and why they're there E. Bruni and Adam berry are with kindred spirits on the TLC Friday nights now in their second season even the piece you mention arm this is this would be an interesting opportunity to sort of corroborate if for example %HESITATION you capture an EVP of somebody's grandmother let's say and they have a memory of their grandmother they may even have a recording of their grandmother's voice and then now you can you can compare I mean would that be a wonderful opportunity to sort of verify the you know the EVP and verified life after death I mean absolutely every year and we've actually only one hour each year we caught in season one %HESITATION was the EVP are of a man who was it rather our client and and he had mental disability in town he was in his thirties but he kind of operated on the out of all of my cow fourteen year old a thirteen year old and he had this habit of playing with race cars and he made very specific sound when he did it and she didn't tell us about that and we caught EDP because we've laid out race cars because we heard you like to play with and we cani VP of him actually making this very sound and she recognized it immediately really Rick how her what we thought it was or anything issue she heard it she knew who it Wierd that and even if the motion of what he did while he made this sound and so yeah I mean if only we had the complete your him doing it or something religious her confirmation was enough grass and that that that's pretty great we can get something like that right de the idea that a ghosts have a a consciousness a I mean you run into cases where what what is actually of being encountered is sort of one of those endless loops of you know every night at twelve o'clock uncle Joe climbs the staircase it's in his rocking in other words it's it's just kind of spiritual laundry there's no consciousness there it's just an empty envelope yeah I mean you know residual Hans are very common and I would say %HESITATION you know they happen and we'd expect out with expats I feel like %HESITATION you know if if you experience a residual Hyatt you're you're in the right place at the right time and for us you know we we spend you know for five days with of with the family so if they say you know an entity comes in the store everyday at noon even in the daytime because he was like we invested in that we do it and anytime of the day we will go and wait for the sensitive come into the room when they say it comes into the room I think %HESITATION %HESITATION that they do exist by %HESITATION you know you hear footsteps a lot we can hear foot steps into the house and those could be residual anything that doesn't interact with us but just kind of continues on its own %HESITATION %HESITATION you know we it if it's a currently caught on tape in and we've experienced it and into I don't know if that's a you know an energy imprint is that's the theory of that it's just like an energy imprint of time and happens and then and it may never happen again or it ever it may happen everyday or every year %HESITATION it's just one of those you know crazy unexplainable phenomena and which is why I called supernatural but how can you what can you do about a residual haunting talk it you can't you can't talk to it you can communicate with again well I I think a lot of what we need to know it actually isn't further dialogue because I the time we've gotten there yet these are pretty extreme hunting and they're very interactive they're deathly trying to get some sort of message across I think with most residual type hunting you know we don't I mean I can't say we've come into arteries cases was very intelligent type current but that also happen to have a residual going there and we kind of just coach them on that they hate you have this and to be here not very well aware of you are aware of what's going on you know you can try to tell it to stop or whatever but just know that it's not harmful %HESITATION a end and some people like to into subscribe to the theory that they can cleanse that Beijing kind of you know just let that energy into an integral be and I wish I could say you know in in all my years that always works but I keep finding people where it doesn't work and so I I don't know I mean everything we do theory and honestly the more we do and spent the last I feel like I know how good my %HESITATION with those kind of things did you try to kind of educate them and let them know that Hey you're not any danger it's not anything that's going to do anything crazy I just know that it's here and what kind of lingering and and is there an opportunity for families %HESITATION when you're when you're trying to rid them of you know that the the ghost of a relative is there an opportunity for that the family to sort of get closure and say one final goodbye before they head to the light or whatever it is that happens on the and is that something that's a regular part of the show I think there are though they what was huge is just that kind of moment in that epiphany like their confirmation that one what they've been experiencing is valid into quitting kind of a name or a face to what they've been experiencing and that in itself is there is a very emotional element of the show %HESITATION and and the yes they did they talk to them that they tell them you know their whereabouts and they tell them thank you are they tell them Hey please leave it here hope %HESITATION but but yes and and %HESITATION and again that you know it is this this moment of kind of solving the key that is our version of going to the light per se and that whole culmination is what kind of makes things slowed down for these people sound yeah they think they have that moment where they say whatever they need to say %HESITATION and hopefully that is not %HESITATION in some cases not some cases that they activity continues because whatever they're you know they're not interested in leaving their interest in remaining a part of the family alright Indian Adam thank you so much Friday nights TLC kindred spirits any Bruni and Adam Barry just remind our next hour the multiple wave oscillator with

I. in the office of alien properties swept in and removed at least two truckloads of his papers some from the hotel itself but Tesla had files and papers a stored all over Manhattan among those papers his journals relating to his work on anti gravity discredited in his time Tesla was made out by business competitors on the government to be nothing more than a kook none the less the same conspirators later duplicated and possibly even stole many of his most fabulous inventions which could soon change the course of history as well as our lives in the first two hours of the program again author researcher Tim Swartz will be here he is the author of the lost journal of journals of Nikola Tesla sensational data obtained from that inventors most private papers and kept under wraps by the military and big business concerns Schwartz researches led him to conclude that test was most sensitive and controversial inventions were put into top secret use by inventions of the New World order and the global political monetary elite in that many of toughest test was most powerful and potentially dangerous scientific discoveries are being turned against ordinary citizens programs of behavior and psychological modification this is being done Schwartz says to influence our critical thinking in belief patterns to make us more susceptible to the mental commands of the secret government Tesla Schwartz says fought all his life against the big corporations who tried to keep his fantastic inventions a secret now more than ever he says the planet needs the inventions of Nikola Tesla to free us from big oil and the wealthy elite team Schwartz and the lost journals of Nikola Tesla next come on in weary traveler hang your cloak on a peg grab a stool and come gather round the fire there are stories to be told you are among friends this is coast to coast AM I'm Richard Serra what if you stay awhile Jim Schwartz is a television producer videographer and author as a photojournalist he's traveled extensively and investigated paranormal phenomena another another and usual mysteries from such diverse locations as the great pyramid in Egypt and the great wall in China Tim is the writer and editor of the online newsletter conspiracy journal considered essential reading by paranormal researchers worldwide is also the host of the webcast program the outer edge heard on PS and radio and he's the author of several books including admiral Byrd's secret journey beyond the polls the final nail in your coffin a pox to all of mankind and the lost journals of Nikola Tesla ATM welcome to coast to coast AM how are you why Richard it's pleasure being with you tonight how could a brilliant mind like Nikola Tesla a man who gave us TV radio alternating current robotics microwaves you name it how could someone like that guy virtually penniless well you know that is that is the mystery that %HESITATION that I've been trying to learn uncover all of these years %HESITATION as as I've research Tesla I've come to the conclusion that %HESITATION there's a good possibility that %HESITATION perhaps he %HESITATION he wasn't as penniless and forgotten as history seems to want us to think %HESITATION there according to %HESITATION in the I was a newly released but actually they've been out for a few years %HESITATION release paper F. B. I. papers and the United States %HESITATION government in the FBI seem to have been keeping a very close watch on Tesla in his final years I'm sure they did but but before he was living at the New Yorker wasn't yet he was at various hotels I think he was for a time at the Waldorf Astoria running up bills not paying them being asked to leave kind of leaving the life of a vagabond but yet he had this relationship with George Westinghouse %HESITATION who I at one point paid him quite a tidy sum you know they were quite kind of partnering on %HESITATION alternating current %HESITATION and he must be in either burning through money awfully fast or he he I don't know what he had the money taken from him by unscrupulous managers what happened well probably a little bit of %HESITATION here from column a different column be %HESITATION tests love when he there's there's no doubt in special in his early year era later years it that he'd he'd become pretty eccentric %HESITATION he wasn't that good with money but he was such a brilliant mind that %HESITATION you know it it's it's funny that %HESITATION you have somebody who had invented the AC motor is as you said the introduction %HESITATION who radio and they're very early %HESITATION of robotics and that sort of thing is that he just did not pay that much attention to the money that was coming in as long as he had phones to support his experiments and his event inventions that he was happy and he had other people who would %HESITATION take care of is my for him and if these people or unscrupulous and then you know he was kind of left in the lurch so he had %HESITATION wealthy benefactors all through his life that that that help support him and that that one up right into his %HESITATION his very final days where his bills were being taken care of yet he managed to get kicked out of a a number of our hotels and the Indian up in the New Yorker of air in Manhattan %HESITATION which also oddly enough had a very substantial FBI presence %HESITATION tell me more about that that's interesting yeah I Joerg who were actually had put out a %HESITATION a notification for agents who were willing to live in the New Yorker at the same time that test will is there %HESITATION their %HESITATION as there wasn't any indication on what these agents were supposed to be doing there but I don't think it was a coincidence that here you had the %HESITATION twentieth century's greatest inventor %HESITATION living in the New Yorker and %HESITATION and also still conducting %HESITATION research and experiments in a secret laboratory %HESITATION located them floors above %HESITATION Tesla sweet so %HESITATION why it was fear Gruver interesting is interested in having FBI agents living at the New Yorker and that obviously keeping track on what Tess was doing I'm not sure the timing of that but because his his arch rival Thomas Edison died early nineteen thirties yeah what is is that part because what we know that's that's and while they were battling for who would win you know that the rights to the standard of electricity Teslin Addison this this rivalry that had that that that Edison was spying on Teslin test was spying on Edison and and and test of course are a rather Edison rather had had partnered with General Electric is it is it possible that that J. Edgar Hoover was spying on Tesla at the behest of a either Edison or General Electric that's always a possibility %HESITATION duh my conclusion is that %HESITATION Tesla was working for of the United States government have to time of his death now there are stories of course about %HESITATION the Philadelphia experiment %HESITATION which which took place actually shortly after Tesla passed away %HESITATION but some rumors had it that %HESITATION tassels contributing to a research %HESITATION to the early days %HESITATION but the Philadelphia experiment and %HESITATION and that's that because of this and because of its its highly %HESITATION classifieds at the research the FBI and probably the %HESITATION early version of the CIA the OSS %HESITATION was keeping test would close at hand because according to the FBI papers there were a number of foreign powers very interested in getting their hands on this and other material or possibly even kidnapping test what about the the anti gravity technology that the test was working on and how badly yeah who would get the U. S. government wanna get their hands on that how how much how aware of it worth a I think actually that the United States government was more interested at the time in %HESITATION here's %HESITATION his death the %HESITATION but %HESITATION I should add that even though the United States that at least did it appear to be interested and test was %HESITATION early field propulsion %HESITATION research %HESITATION **** Germany definitely and %HESITATION I there is to me there's some very good evidence to show that the east coast a **** spy ring that hat was firmly entrenched in Manhattan pasta and %HESITATION even wash and I see had already %HESITATION by the time capsule passed away in nineteen oh forty three they had already got a hold of a lot of %HESITATION Tesla's material and had %HESITATION that taking it out of the country and %HESITATION and back to Germany so I think that if the United States was interested in %HESITATION anti gravity technology at that point it was only because they realized that **** Germany had a hold of it was Tesla perceived and he was a **** he was a Serbian American but was he put eve as a patriot it was %HESITATION test what was fiercely proud that he was a citizen of the United States %HESITATION is does she did maintain actually loyalty %HESITATION to to Yugoslavia and in fact %HESITATION he had proposed to the Yugoslavian government %HESITATION to %HESITATION provide for them a series of of of his death beams to be located at %HESITATION various locations around Yugoslavia to help %HESITATION fight and at that point I mean everybody was interested invading the Yugoslavia he had yelled the Nazis yet that the Soviet Union and so Tesla had actually written at the Yugoslavian government de with this plan on how old they could protect themselves %HESITATION from these %HESITATION foreign powers so yes I mean he was very %HESITATION loyal to the United States but he also naturally had a warm spot for the of the land that he was born Jim Schwartz is with us television producer videographer author of the lost journals of Nikola Tesla okay he also wrote about his if we were able to identify the the resonant frequency of planet earth week this planet open like a Walmart and was that of concern that when when he was writing about that talking about that and you know given his genius what were was the government concerned about that kind of that kind of the pursuit of knowledge they were I don't know if they actually believed that that that Tesla could do it but practically anything that Tesla wrote about and said that he could do %HESITATION if he was he was believed even though publicly officials would denounce Tesla's sale well you know he's at at this point he's is that he's eccentric yeah he's old enough to know what he's talking about %HESITATION with in the inner circles of %HESITATION bill Terry in the government everyone knew very well that this was a guy that that if he made a statement you had to listen to %HESITATION bar and do you know the the the newspapers at that time were also I mean they love Tesla every year on his birthday they would set him down they had interviewing when asking you know miss Tesla what it what kind of fabulous invention have you come up with this year and then he would love to regale you know all these fantastic stories so %HESITATION but %HESITATION you know when he would talk about these things you know the %HESITATION officials would sit up and pay close attention to what he was saying so January of nineteen forty three %HESITATION he dies what other what other circumstances %HESITATION of his death I mean he was in his eighties he was and he was frail yeah ha how how was it how was his death at the scabbard and and %HESITATION what happened in the immediate aftermath world at that point %HESITATION Tesla %HESITATION if he was still somewhat recovering from an accident it had %HESITATION a year before where he was hit by a taxicab %HESITATION there in Manhattan when he sees it and I think any other person it would have been killed but Tessler was of a strong of stock that day and despite his age and he was able to to to recover but he actually just ended up %HESITATION dine alone in his bed of of cardiac arrest and it wasn't until that next morning when a maid come came to that make up his room that he was discovered dead %HESITATION almost as soon as word got out that he had passed away %HESITATION tests whose nephew general by the name of Saleh Cassavetes who was actually an official with the %HESITATION Yugoslavian governments %HESITATION him and a couple of other people quickly went to test was room with a locksmith because in test was sweet there in the New Yorker he had a a a massive save as well as a number of of drawers and cabinets that that that held %HESITATION test was so tense was most important %HESITATION papers now %HESITATION Cassavetes and some of the other people who were with him claim that the only thing that they were interested in after the locksmith broke open the safe was getting some personal effects some photographs and they are about of our booklets that had been given to test all on his birthday a couple years previously that had been signed by a number of of it %HESITATION famous people celebrities world officials and that sort of thing a detriment claims and the and and the sea safe was that sealed back are up again and they went on now that the FBI documents %HESITATION there were a number of informants who testified that that I'm %HESITATION lose sight of that and these other people actually %HESITATION took away very important papers probably dealing with that death beam and then nobody really knows for sure and this is one of the great mysteries on tap deathless death because it was this mad scramble to try to get hold of everything that they possibly could and we're not quite sure who all the players were means is you have to use the I have the office of alien property %HESITATION the O. S. as you have %HESITATION friends private inventors %HESITATION like that and %HESITATION so nobody officially has any idea just exactly what disappeared and and and and deal put in place what importance he's missing papers that yeah and you as you point out it was just the FBI it was the office of alien properties which you know given some of the areas that Tesla delve into and and some of his claims you know %HESITATION ET contact and so forth that name has kind of an ominous of feeling about it but we'll we'll discuss that further also you know how much a did the FBI take away how much did the %HESITATION office of alien properties take away and and what sort of documents were included would it include his his journals on Angie Gravett ex and so forth will come back and discuss with Tim Swartz also the president trump connection to Nicola Tesla here's Jerry Lee Lewis and his cover of led Zeppelin's rock and roll taking us into the break on coast to coast AM Saint Paul and the broken bones they hail from Birmingham Alabama check him out residents of a city in Oregon were understandably unnerved this past week when they spotted someone dressed as the infamous character slender man shuffling down the street and our webmaster tonight Greg bishop has posted the story in the highlights section at coast to coast A.

Tesla was born during a particularly violent lightning storm and this is a a bad omen for some but to the midwife asserted that this meant Tesla would be a child of darkness Tesla's mom probably affronted by this woman's assertion immediately replied no he will be a child of light stay with us on coast to coast a welcome back to coast to coast AM Richard Serra coming to you live from coast Toronto Canada affiliate talk radio AM six forty Tim Swartz is with us author of the lost journals of Nikola Tesla you mentioned that with it to one of the agencies that swept in our end and took many of his journals and papers from the New Yorker after Tesla's death was the office of alien properties and I mentioned going into the break that no given Tesla's fascination with extraterrestrials and and %HESITATION the %HESITATION you know sort of the %HESITATION of the paranormal that this sounds like a rather ominous agency who who wants or what is the office of alien property stamp the office Bailey in property %HESITATION was a branch of the United States %HESITATION governments of special importance %HESITATION during World War two to %HESITATION %HESITATION make sure that any %HESITATION foreign nationals that were living in the United States at the time %HESITATION who you know weren't %HESITATION part of any kind of %HESITATION it will spy organization working for a a government that %HESITATION may be hostile to the United States and basically %HESITATION what the opposite really property was able to do was that if somebody was declared to be part of possible the rat and I'm talking about it on non US citizens living in the United States if they were declared to be a threat them the office really property had the ability the legal ability to swoop in and basically %HESITATION take anything that they deemed unnecessary and %HESITATION parts of what was rather unusual about %HESITATION them involved with Tesla is that tessellated naturalized United States citizen and legally they would not have been able to see this Tess was property like they did however %HESITATION after this set of the vice president of the United States of the time and in cooperation with the FBI those rules were basically %HESITATION thrown out at possibly as a cover because it really was the FBI who %HESITATION was responsible for for coming in and and %HESITATION trying to get hold of as much Tessa materials possible and then they use the legal pretense of %HESITATION the office of alien property to basically do their dirty work for them can I ask you about a connection to up between rather a Tesla and president Donald Trump trumps uncle jontron was %HESITATION engineer at at MIT yeah I ended its been said that he was asked by the government to review some of these papers that were a taken by the FBI in the the office of alien properties after test was that is that true yes yes very much to John a jaunty trump who is the %HESITATION paternal uncle of %HESITATION president trump %HESITATION John trump was the %HESITATION very %HESITATION renowned scientist with a with MIT and at that time %HESITATION that that he was also is involved with the with the military now John trump woes a %HESITATION %HESITATION an electrical engineer and physicist along the same lines of Tesla and in fact that the two had kind of had a run in %HESITATION years previously when and Tesla proved that %HESITATION one of his small Tesla coils %HESITATION would far out %HESITATION them out to the van de Graaff generators that %HESITATION John trump was working on at the time it would take a downdraft generator about the size of a %HESITATION river a boxcar to %HESITATION produce the electrical energy that a small Tesla coil aho would produce so it's it's very interesting that you know you that they brought him to to look at the material that said the FBI in the office feeling property %HESITATION mandates to %HESITATION gets that from test well this was all taken to the Manhattan storage warehouse at that fifty second the fifty second street and Seventh Avenue in New York City tussle already had some thirty barrels and bond papers %HESITATION at this warehouse and they brought in another probably have some of %HESITATION truckloads full %HESITATION but there was probably then %HESITATION it was said another at least eighty barrels up material scattered around Manhattan and %HESITATION New Jersey at the time that possibly had not de been found so then %HESITATION John trump was brought in to examine this material to try to discover if there is anything %HESITATION worth keeping now remember how much of this stuff I said was seized and taken to this warehouse yet trump and %HESITATION a couple of other people from %HESITATION naval intelligence and the like spent less than two days going through their stuff and then afterwards at at trump the %HESITATION wrote a letter declaring that %HESITATION even though Tesla had been a great scientists in his day none of the material that he looks through %HESITATION offered in the potential usefulness to the United States government my understanding is that it is also that that that John trump and president trump's paternal uncle a developed high voltage xray generators that could extend the lives of cancer patients yeah it did he do you think that he you know is that that old saying %HESITATION you know if we have seen further it's because we stood on the shoulders of giants did did trump perhaps borrow from Tesla I think everybody up borrowed from that flat %HESITATION in I I I don't I don't want to go and and you know besmirch the character of of somebody you know like John trapped because I mean he did do %HESITATION great %HESITATION work of his own but I have no doubt that that that he helped further his career and other people as well %HESITATION using a test loose ideas especially based on %HESITATION the things that %HESITATION that that trump did afterwards after he examined %HESITATION %HESITATION Tesla's material and I should point out also that one of the gentleman who was with trapped in those days %HESITATION going to test will starve a was basically a spy for the navy whose %HESITATION of soul %HESITATION abilities wise as a %HESITATION %HESITATION this guy had the ability to break in to anything anywhere without anybody knowing about so probably what it was that they cased the joint decker Seri examination and then came back later and was able to break into this warehouse %HESITATION photographed Michael film anything and everything that they wanted all the while declaring that there was nothing of value here and no no need to keep looking folks and this that direct your attentions elsewhere so and I should point out is like like you said trapped not only did he work with a high voltage %HESITATION electricity %HESITATION for cancer one of his most %HESITATION famous abilities %HESITATION wise he is %HESITATION work in two generating streaming high voltages of electricity in the use of nuclear power nuclear generators I and and things like that %HESITATION our %HESITATION our own modern nuclear reactors are based on trumped %HESITATION research on generating %HESITATION high electrical fields %HESITATION instituted to help %HESITATION keep these %HESITATION that absolutely massive reactors are going Lou whether or not this was based on anything that Tesla had there are some interesting similarities I wanna get into Tesla's anti gravity coils what what what was the principle behind his his work with Andy Griffith ex and a great graphics was one of the things that %HESITATION test will work on it and and he actually %HESITATION was doing research along these lines quite a ways back I mean you know you were talking about very early nineteen hundreds and this all came about from his research into the %HESITATION production and all of them Arab but of generating and stripping teen electricity %HESITATION without wires %HESITATION Tesla had gone to Colorado springs to research the sea of %HESITATION lightning could be harnessed as an energy source and at the same time he was trying to see whether or not that there was a the ability to create a residence not only with %HESITATION the the ionosphere %HESITATION but also %HESITATION with the earth itself to see if our electricity could be a propagated over a wide differences a during this research %HESITATION he started %HESITATION findings have very interesting effects %HESITATION with %HESITATION you what we now would call %HESITATION %HESITATION %HESITATION from many critics %HESITATION and that it was one of the things that if he had some money to work on it he'd work on it for awhile and then he'd work on %HESITATION some of the other things that I'm not quite sure if Tesla actually realized in these early days %HESITATION just what he had a hold of %HESITATION you have people later on like he taunts brown who took a lot of this research even further %HESITATION but %HESITATION it out Tesla had noticed that you know very interesting facts written very interesting affect when it came to %HESITATION of capacitors and their ability to move in a direction %HESITATION win those charged %HESITATION who is specially when using a Tesla coil %HESITATION as he grew older and unfortunately he did not have the laboratory space of the money to %HESITATION of conduct Denson research but he would write about %HESITATION these in these amazing the facts on the possibility that he was looking at a %HESITATION out of a fuel propulsion technology you know %HESITATION and we call that anti gravity but actually it involves using hi %HESITATION frequencies of electricity to earn the gate gravity so to speak in in my understanding and an Iraqi hummock a neophyte %HESITATION when it comes to this but the ideas that if you if you were to place three Tesla coils in a triangle objects placed inside the trying to levitate is that is a true %HESITATION that is one of the %HESITATION egg experiments that that have school worked on now what we don't know and and this is one of the unfortunate things about test for is that you know he had indeed tactic memory so if he did not feel that he had to write everything down in a like a lot of researchers and scientists you know would do I mean he experiment and he remembered exactly %HESITATION what he would have to do the next time a lot of the material that we have from Tesla actually was written down by his assistants you know who didn't have you know his his amazing %HESITATION memory %HESITATION but %HESITATION but yes I mean %HESITATION this was just one of the types of experiments that that test was doing you know involving a Tesla coils and whether or not %HESITATION this type of %HESITATION of the Butler of high frequency energy could actually have a a a type of anti gravity of fact %HESITATION what we don't know is whether or not he was running across something that we now know as what's called ionic %HESITATION the ionic wind %HESITATION but it doesn't appear to be it does appear to me that %HESITATION Tessa seemed to have an idea that there was a difference %HESITATION between the ionic wind a fact %HESITATION electricity and what he was trying to do %HESITATION he attempted this experiment as well in a vacuum chamber or at least the closest that that he could come up with at the time of vacuum businesses chamber %HESITATION and he was able to achieve the same kinds of effects if this was simply I and I ionic win the fact this would not happen in a vacuum this idea you require an atlas %HESITATION towards and make wind of fact and and test was experiencing show that this was something that would also occur in a vacuum which I mean that is mind boggling and something apparently at least as as far as we know here in the civilian world has not been accomplished yet so we're talking about %HESITATION laser before test who's doing these experiments in the early nineteen hundreds and allegedly you know we can't duplicate that now so he was obviously on to something I imagine somebody somewhere knows just exactly what he was doing but unfortunately we're not privy to that information well I'm looking at a picture of the these are the blueprints for his propulsion system he called it a space drive the or the anti electromagnetic field propulsion I'm sure people have seen the this this picture online again of his blueprints many many times but it it certainly looks like a and this is you know before his death services prior to nineteen forty three it looks all the world like for example what Kenneth Arnold described in nineteen forty seven flying saucers when we have to be careful with is whether or not this blueprint is one hundred percent offend %HESITATION Tesla a when he would draw up these plans when he would file patents he would leave crucial information out because he was always suspicious and and for good reason that %HESITATION people were going to try to steal his ideas from him and and profit off of whatever on the Marconi here's a brief example Marconi use several said fourteen of his patent %HESITATION in order to %HESITATION creed area radio transmitter transmitter so %HESITATION whether or not we are looking at something %HESITATION with these blueprints and that that Tesla himself actually put together or somebody later put together based on tests of ideas %HESITATION you know I'm I'm not quite sure myself %HESITATION that its is looking at these blueprints they do seem to indicate that this was based on tests of work I don't know whether or not this was something put together by Tesla personally %HESITATION some of his assistants based on tests whose work or if this is %HESITATION disinformation you know because there's a lot of %HESITATION material out there that's just plain and simple disinformation %HESITATION that I think has been put out by a %HESITATION the CIA and %HESITATION and other a letter groups to try to %HESITATION dissuade people from paying that close attention to %HESITATION tassels brain work you know they can go I think it does seem though that like he was prepared towards the end of his life to make some sort of a nature a major announcement about his theories of gravity yeah die his dynamic theory of gravity which if I'm not mistaken was sort of in direct opposition with with Einstein %HESITATION it seemed like he was getting close yeah yeah well I mean and and he had been close %HESITATION for quite awhile I mean this was basically a test was unified field theory and that he was working on it is that %HESITATION and %HESITATION he he wrote %HESITATION quite a few details about it but as for actual release %HESITATION of his %HESITATION his idea that never came about possibly because %HESITATION he passed away possibly because somebody %HESITATION or or or or some group told him not to in all of this is something that this was a security issue and we're going to take it from here Mr Tesla %HESITATION thank you very much for your work but that this is %HESITATION %HESITATION you know nobody else is is privy to see this right now %HESITATION but but yes I mean Tesla was extremely close if not successful in alright we'll take a time out stay where you are team will come back bottom of the the the next hour we'll open up the phone lines take questions and comments the loss to journals of Nikola Tesla with Tim Swartz the great Dinah Washington taking us into the break with soul ville on coast to coast AM  |||||||||| from the heartland of America and the gateway to the west good morning good evening where ever you may be across the nation around the world I'm George nor you welcome to coast to coast AM later on tonight the occult and other mysteries but here's what's happening well there say North Korea should include detonated city Boston New anytime now to reignite its deadly feud with us the United States according to experts Kim gendarmes regime is keen to display a chilling show of force with another age bomb test and they say the timing could be any day we shall see Charles R. Smith who has been our expert on the Korean situation is with us Charles what's going on what you're taken are you're always looking for great information for us yeah it would appear that the north Koreans are probably going to launch the long range missile that would be capable of hitting the United States as %HESITATION it would likely that it's going to happen on either the ten is the year the anniversary of the north Korean work which is this morning now this is right now yes exactly and they either that or on the sixteenth which is when the %HESITATION Chinese Berg communist Congress need so there is a good possibility %HESITATION that the Japanese are on full alert at the moment there are indications from my own sources that in the long range %HESITATION cage fourteen is readying itself and could very well be launched like I said in in a demonstration flight somewhere in the South Pacific to show that it can reach the United States will we attempt to take it down Charles probably not will be more interested in getting the flight telemetry as well as watching the trajectory in re entry to see if the thing actually works now you have been speculating since the get go that there would be no our military conflict after this test if it happens what do you think could happen are you still no conflict on the horizon however it is %HESITATION extremely tense yes if the north Koreans do alewives test meaning they actually put a lot of work ahead on it well look I could change things rather radically Charles will talk to you this week and what's a keep our fingers crossed and pre Israeli police say they were on the lookout for teenagers in clown masks after a few years at the craze could cause violent reactions from those being frightened with dozens already detained apparently twelve youngsters including two fourteen year olds have been arrested over the past few days there while Stephen paddock the man who carried out the mass shootings in Las Vegas apparently gambled up to a million dollars a night and frequently popped valium for anxiety and the deposition the sixty four year old delivered four years ago as part of a civil lawsuit against the hotel where he said he had slipped and fell the one time accountant portrayed himself as a big Spender who was frequently copped by our casinos for his rooms fifty nine people dead five hundred twenty seven wounded a lot of those have been released from the hospital now those who were wounded in that horrible episode on October first but let's check in with Dr Peter Breguet our resident psychiatrist and author of medication madness in guilt shame anxiety doctor Peter if he was on valium and used it a lot and we don't know how much you use what does that do to someone well first week we don't know %HESITATION we do have now two prescriptions one that was %HESITATION from two thousand thirteen that he was given four years ago that came out in the death blow and then we have another prescription that we know he's talked %HESITATION that he was given for ten milligram tablets for fifty %HESITATION about a hundred and five days ago so we had about one a day if you use them all up %HESITATION well first when when I'm hearing a large volume so I'm not sure what he's doing and there's no question that valium diazepam is its chemical can coolers disinhibition violence anger people can even become psychotic on it I've had cases with drugs like here's the one dose of course people to get disinhibited anti behave in ways with a violent ways when they wouldn't have what should prescribe for doc well it it's mostly prescribed for anxiety is that the original mother's little helper used to be called the decades ago %HESITATION for %HESITATION for anxiety and tension and some people use it for sleep the thing is it's not the pattern of drug use that I see associated with this with these violent %HESITATION episodes %HESITATION %HESITATION you usually is %HESITATION there's an anti depressant vials but see we wouldn't know whether he's getting an anti depressant we know about the recent valium because somebody leaked information from %HESITATION the %HESITATION prescription monitoring program tada that's that's programs only gonna pick up drugs that are scheduled that I watched by the D. E. A. and that would not include anti depressants self yet this is a drug victory because %HESITATION under certain circumstances because a lot of good disturbance and even violence that have not seen the pattern don't have enough information right now are you still puzzled by this case Peter how I mean we've had about a week now to look at it and it's very strange yeah I think it's a surprise though I mean the calm of the common things we see in people who will do it outburst of violence unexpectedly all the day they're usually not not not living with a family and he wasn't they usually kinda loners they usually will quirky which he certainly was they can be brilliant or not the neelys sounds like he was a brilliant guy he's an overbearing guy from some of the anecdotes you here but none of that Jimmy we if we weren't trying to %HESITATION and a finger people with that description we think we we get now where there's so many folks in a different world difference I don't that I don't put a lot of stock in anything I'm hearing especially because he was doing this for quite some time the least a year the latest we've got got now is de you know from public sources is that he began to increase buying guns a year ago did it go with that with a psychiatric drug like valium I'm not sure I don't know yet George okay theater thank you for your advice appreciate it lots of stories out there on the internet about this case some of that fake news be careful what you read I mean all kinds of crazy things are out there I shades out of the movie psycho a Minnesota man who

when he picked that everybody a cuppa coffee that the existence of intelligent extraterrestrials will be confirmed within the next two decades maybe let's check in with doctor sky Stephen Kate's what else will we find their Stephen what George we begin in first say hello to all our listeners out there we talk about Mahler's and astronauts who would make that nine month journey to Mars the real danger is not just the boredom that you might have of sitting there or the heavy workload it's the radiation problems in space so NASA has just given a special symposium on how to shield astronauts in space and they're actually looking into the potential of maybe even altering human DNA to withstand the rigors of these high doses of radiation out in space what type radiation Georgia we talking about heavy cosmic rays solar radiation from players and of course escaping the earth's gravity and its magnetic field the van Allen belts but we may have to look closer to home to us even says looking at these little little animals lose little microscopic creatures called tardigrades if these tiny little creatures that can withstand radiation outside and spacecraft holding high temperature totally amazing and maybe some of the enzymes in these tiny little tardigrades be something along the way the perfect humans to handle space George we talked last week about this incredible Astrud twenty twelve to yeah or here's the skinny on it right now it'll be closer to the earth this Thursday morning the twelve what exactly one forty five AM stern they like time nobody's sure how close the object will get upwards of about sixteen meters in diameter the very close predictions are within about forty five hundred miles NASA says maybe as close as thirty one thousand miles but the interesting point is the subject is extremely close to put it mildly moving well within the geosynchronous satellites and another interesting fact the very large telescope in Chile actually recovered this back on July the twenty seventh making it one of the faintest objects ever recovered and this little ash towards the first known nationally to observe place passing within one lunar distance of the earth the live sky George we look into the morning sky the moon moves under which last quarter Venus still beautiful low into the southeastern part of the sky and the planet Jupiter still take a look at it as it moves in the west just after sunset into so we're going but this guy reminds everyone always always remember to keep your eyes to the skies and email me DR Scully microscope it talks you gotta thanks doctor sky appreciated up next Gregg Braden joins us his latest work human by design from evolution by chance to transformation by choice I'm looking forward to this talk with Greg next on coast to coast area and welcome back to coast to coast Gregg Braden is internationally renowned as a pioneer in bridging science spirituality in human potential from nineteen seventy nine to nineteen ninety he work for fortune five hundred companies as a problem solver during times of crisis he continues problem solving today this he kind of weaves modern science in the was to preserve the remote monasteries and forgotten text into real world solutions his latest work is called human by design from evolution by chance a transformation by choice Greg looking forward to this this is a great work by print or thank you good evening %HESITATION for my times over morning to where you are George it's great to hear your voice I'm I'm excited to talk about this new work nine you know this year your cheek jerking your answering questions that have plagued in perplexed so many of us who are we what are we where did we come from it even though we might not have the definitive answers at least you're scratching the surface in getting even deeper Greg what would I I think supporting George we I I don't know when we will have the definitive answers but what is very very clear right now I'm I'm a geologist a good degree geologist and we %HESITATION as geologist anthropologist we've been looking at this question who are we where we come from for a hundred and fifty years now it's very clear that we're barking up the wrong tree and when we can free the scientific minds in the resources in the technology performance be obsolete story that is being taught as fact in our public schools today where does George is it it frees the hearts and the minds of these brilliant people so that they can follow the evidence to where ever it may lead rather than trying to force the evidence that's being discovered that into a pre existing idea right wanting that that's what's important here what have we been talked in school in college what we've been taught about our school fifties sixties and seventies yeah what to me taught to our young people today has not changed much since that time and when it comes to to humans I I want to be very clear with %HESITATION with our listeners on where I stand with its evolution in itself is a fact %HESITATION as a geologist I've seen it in the fossil record for many forms of of animals some forms of plant life it breaks down the idea of evolution breaks down when it comes to humans yet evolution is not our story %HESITATION but we are being taught that evolution is our story %HESITATION that we are the byproduct of essentially a fluke of nature an accident of biology I am there to thinking that goes with that Jordan when work type that we are this act in biology we lose uniqueness I am the specialness of of human life and we lose the value of human life and that reality is being reflected everything I just heard you talking about in the news return on the six o'clock news the only way that the events that unfold in our world today can unfold as they are I is because of a way of thinking that devalues human life and it all comes back to to the way that we've been taught to think so I had experience I would improve with %HESITATION group just a few weeks ago and I I didn't list any news for for three weeks I came back and I know you've had this experience I came back and through our a Dallas fort worth airport as I was walking my connecting flight every gate at a news broadcast that was happening so I was getting cart upon the news is walking through the concourse it's almost like time travel when it was very I mean it was you know everything about you S. in North Korea about hate crimes based on sexual orientation had you heard about Las Vegas at that time that had not happened yet okay art cyberbullying our domestic you know violence drug abuse a means of the heroin epidemic that is %HESITATION it's not just in America at that American Europe and so I was doing like a fast forward of all the news administering those three weeks I sat down on the plane for my my flight back to Albuquerque and what I realize your time I'm a systems thinker %HESITATION and a problem solver and I realize that as different as everyone of those stories was that I was hearing in each of those gates there was a through line the fundamental principle that Waldron altogether it all comes down to the way we think about ourselves those those things came out terrorism and the atrocities that are are happening all over the world %HESITATION the slavery as many distefano things we're hearing it's only possible because of the way we have been taught to think about ourselves and what I realized it's you know it's it's good we can try to fix one problem here one problem therein in its well intentioned but the bottom line for me is that all of the things that we're trying to do to fix these things it's only a band aid George until we get to the root of the core of where these problems come from I including what is happened Los Vegas yeah quitting what's happening with the US and North Korea it all comes down the way we think about ourselves and we have an opportunity now to teach a new generation a new way of thinking based upon peer reviewed science that is not being shared in the mainstream media although it is it is peer reviewed and it's telling us that is in the DNA evidence we're going to get into tonight the DNA evidence is what is really %HESITATION open the door to what scientists are calling for bidden territory when it comes to you and me now where we come from and how we have come to be as we are in the world today so for me that's very exciting because we're on the verge run it right on the cusp of a new human story that is emerging and it is a beautiful story of empowerment and hope and possibility of the time I think we we when we need it the most your geologist your scientists yet you bridge spirituality quite a bit with your work is that difficult for you to do that well I'm gonna make a distinction between spirituality and religion %HESITATION big difference the out the weather's a different spin in my work %HESITATION as a geologist in and I've always been fascinated by ancient civilisations ancient technologies %HESITATION ever since I was five years old so I there is no doubt my mind what I was going to do for a living and what I was going to go into so to to research %HESITATION didn't think has lasted me I've had to go George to some of the most isolated remote magnificence Christine just beautiful beautiful places remaining on the earth day of in places like the highlands of central China and Tibet in Bolivia the Andes of %HESITATION Peru and Paul in India and all through the desert southwest of the aboriginals in Australia and Africa and as I not only immersed myself in the history was there but in the culture of the people are in the indigenous people there are living today many of the principles that were %HESITATION would burst thousands and thousands of years ago where I saw it's not science a spiritual principles they're not based in science but they are based on principles that science is now bearing out in the key is we ask ourselves the question who am I is an individual who are we collectively our ancestors ask the same question they had answers that works for them then again they weren't science but they were based on the principles of connectivity is our relationship to the cosmos our relationship to our bodies and our relationship to the past and and this is where it gets really interesting for me because we have been taught George that %HESITATION history is linear that civilization primitive civilization began around five thousand years ago Samaria Mesopotamia tigris Euphrates and enters a linear progression in the we are the the the most sophisticated technological civilization ever to grace the face of the earth and the problem with that %HESITATION is that once again the date is no longer supporting what we're finding is that civilization is cyclic rather than linear and that there have been multiple cycles and the cycles are based on these five thousand your rhythms that work were so important we heard about them around twenty twelve and in the mind counter but there's much more to it than that so when we go back into these five thousand year cycles and we see %HESITATION levels of sophistication I mean civilizations there their archeological sites %HESITATION in the contested area between India and Pakistan for example %HESITATION will wear the veil of hot and cold running water they had electrical wires running underground and flush toilets they had mathematics the other strani and you say you know what how can you reset level of of sophistication and have everything collapsed hold on right there Greg we'll take a break but we shall be right back on coast to coast AM in October we have our incredible trivia question contest going you could win five hundred dollars is a lucky winner every week but every day there's a new set of trivia questions and if you get it right you're eligible to go into the half for the pic so that means if you're right five times because we do Monday through Friday you get five entries and then on full information of course and contest rules it coast to coast AM dot com but just for you for a little background here's our trivia question tonight what was the name of the spirit that tormented psychic Michael Bodine as a child a jury be ball regard see mondo di groups get that answer right you'll be in the hat and let's see if you end up winning five hundred dollars for the week some people are having a lot of fun doing it and welcome back to coast to coast Gregg Braden with us author of his latest book human by design Greg you were talking about how ancients possessed high technology what happened to it where did they go well this is where it becomes very relevant %HESITATION in modern times in the cycle that we see in the past and and so far be the peer reviewed science is bearing out three five thousand year cycle so we're looking at least fifteen thousand years into our past %HESITATION war has been what has ended those cycles and we believe the war has come about in different ways different kinds of weapons have been used but the war has has played a key role are you in inning those cycles and the reason I believe that's important is because I think we have to ask ourselves are repeating that cycle now what %HESITATION I had the opportunity I know you've you have not addressed on her doctor Bruce Lipton yes biology believe he and I were invited to speak at the UN %HESITATION not long ago is the team he has a life scientist in me as an earth scientists about %HESITATION sharing our perspective of where we are in history where we are %HESITATION in terms of cycles in rhythms %HESITATION what can we expect we can prepare for you know where we put our resources and they are and I shared with them the the fact that we are now we're living is rare convergence of of three cycles of cycles of climate number that we're very aware of that economic cycles and I think most people were of that the third cycle was a surprise to people to you and it's a cycle of human conflict and they said well we know what do you mean doesn't it just happen when it happens in the answer is no I is that human conflict if you can charted out and there are %HESITATION finest mathematicians of Dundas and I talk about this and some of the other books where conflict ebbs and flows in the beginning and the end of the major wars for the last one thousand years %HESITATION it you can plot against the rise and fall of magnetic fields from the earth from the sun the way they affect society an influence that humans were were more aggressive George when the magnetic fields are lower left a grin fields are high the reason it's important because in twenty fourteen we began our of a period of a cycle of low magnetic that peaks in the year twenty twenty so so we are in right now and I'm going to be very clear doesn't mean we must have conflict is right yes that we are vulnerable and susceptible the conflict and also the greatest times of peace %HESITATION are possible during these times because it requires a tremendous amount of if communication becoming very good listeners %HESITATION in giving one another the benefit of a doubt extending an olive branch %HESITATION you know where and when it comes down right down to the wire so we are following a pattern or if we step back and take a look at it we're right in the thick of a pattern is played out multiple times in our past if we have the wisdom to recognize that then we are certainly not slaves to the patterns that it informs us of what is possible for us so %HESITATION all these this is the context within which we are asking the question who are we in the new discoveries are telling us what we are not we have been told more more more than we ever imagine and and that's important George because of the better we know ourselves unless we fear the unknown the less fear we have when we go into uncharted territory of of converging cycles better we know ourselves the more confident we are to I to work together and and that's why I think this book is so important right now is there a god factor here Gregg there can be %HESITATION as a scientist what I wanted to do you know George when I'm on this program and and I love our listeners our audiences it's what I call primarily the choir and I love the choir we've we need to acquire and if we're going to bring about the kind of change that you in our audience know were possible in this world we've got to reach so far beyond the choir deep deep deep into into corporations into religious thinking in science is %HESITATION is a language this trusted and respected so I've chosen to use science I share this new information %HESITATION about human origins %HESITATION but there certainly are implications and then that is where is it verges on what scientists call forbidden territory so we're going to talk to and if you manage for example about the DNA the DNA that gives us our uniqueness we now know forensic DNA we couldn't actually extract the DNA from the fossilized remains of ancient forms of life some who have been here who thought were thought to be our ancestors if we can build the genome and compare their DNA it's our DNA and what we're finding is the beings that we thought were ancestors are not we did not descend from the end of fall for example of we we know that we share the earth with them we probably interbred with them and and so we do have some the of some manner of all DNA in our genome today we did not descend from them and this is this is a big deal because %HESITATION when I was in school was being taught today that Neanderthals our ancestors that we've evolved from them so this %HESITATION this is an example of %HESITATION where that the DNA is is giving us a new way to think of ourselves so religion %HESITATION it certainly people can impose religion on the ideas but it's possible to talk about this without religious implications I think but you do believe there's intelligent design here over this sort of thing so we're looking at two things George looking physical evidence they were looking at DNA evidence physical evidence %HESITATION I know all of our listeners are familiar with with what's called the %HESITATION the evolutionary tree of life you see it in all of your textbooks and on the you know the history channel specials and the Smithsonian it looks like a tree with the the skulls representing previous forms of life in humans modern humans homo sapiens were always at the top suggesting that we evolved from those other forms of life however if you look closely and and in the the book I actually pulled some of these from places like the Smithsonian so people know it's you know it's not my opinion the lines that connect modern human with those previous forms of life they are broken lines their stash lines if you look at the legend very concerned very big letters but if it is there it says that these relationships are speculative or inferred they're believed to exist however no physical evidence has been found to date to support their existence aside I have for it well I have friends that are friends until we have this conversation in one they say that we simply have not yet looked in the right place find the evidence that links us today's previous forms of of life so after a hundred and fifty years the best minds to the greatest finding the most sophisticated technology is the best university I think if if we were on the right track we would find it more it would be a little closer to where we are right now and that's the theme of the book %HESITATION if we are barking up the wrong tree let free our scientists free the young people that want to dedicate their lives to solving there's there's the deepest mysteries of human existence freedom to follow the evidence where it leads rather than forcing them take the evidence and try to fit it into this pre existing story at the Charles Darwin introduced a hundred fifty years ago when when the unit is that the theory of evolution you have talked about human chromosome number two what's important about or so so I just mentioned so that that the physical evidence does not support the theory revolution many people have known that what has changed Jordan this is like was like %HESITATION if you saw the movie Jurassic Park review what does yes I you know that was all science fiction that is I mention that we can actually extract the DNA %HESITATION from these fossils and we can see what the DNA of these beings was all about and what it's telling us is that humans modern humans we emerged on this world we showed up two hundred thousand years ago right around that period of time suddenly it we've did not evolve gradually slowly over a long period of time we we appeared suddenly as what used to be called when I was in school and many very listeners we speak called crow Majnun that term is no longer used and it's been replaced with another term that is self explanatory did the acronym is eight AM eight it means anatomically modern humans so we modern humans we showed up two hundred thousand years ago George and we haven't changed since we showed up and that is not Darwin's idea of evolution we have the same body proportions now we know we have the same DNA we've got the same genome because they've been able to extract from the bone marrow of the fossils and compare of %HESITATION anatomically modern humans and compare them to use to modern day humans and because he's one of the keys is human chromosome number two %HESITATION Democrat is very mysterious comment on the second largest chromosomes in the human body eight percent of every human cell the is made up the DNA is made up of human chromosome to and it is because of it are human chromosome too that we have a brain fifty percent larger all the sudden George thousand years ago we showed up with a brain fifty percent larger in our nearest a primate relatives and indicates in the chance and the neo cortex that allows us these uniquely human abilities of things like empathy sympathy compassion self regulation of the motion and the ability to self regulate our own immune system our own anti aging in the times %HESITATION deep intuition on demand healing on demand in a way no other form of life has it happened two hundred thousand years ago in this chromosome to %HESITATION what the %HESITATION proceedings for the National Academy of sciences have told us it is the result of a fusion of to pre existing chromosomes in prime primate life %HESITATION they refused thick and after the fusion happen this is this is the kicker after because we do see fusion happening in other forms of life after the fusion happened the resulting chromosome was modified it was tweak there were chromosomes that were are there were jeans that were turned off jeans that were turned on streamline and optimize and remove any redundant features to give us our will be the abilities of of this neo cortex and all the things that are happening with the neo cortex so so that's one thing at the same time George there's another chromosome chromosome number seven it has the gene is called fox P. too that was tweaked in a very precise way to give us the ability for complex speech so is that a question I've always had you know they are primates champs we sure ninety percent the DNA how come at him you know can't things their way to heaven right well maybe they cannot well the reason is because they're Foxy to gene was never tweaked ours was and it happened %HESITATION in this I mean this is the Max Planck institute is telling us that it happened exactly at the same time that the chromosome too was changed exactly the time humans emerged so this is not long slow gradual change over long periods of time this is very fast all at once in many of these kinds of mutations occurring all the same time and what the the science is saying and there is room peer review papers are saying this is beyond what can be accounted for through evolution alone as we know it today something else happened and that these fusions and the modifications after the fusions and this is this is where we breach on the forbidden territory they appear to be intentional and that's all that science can say science cannot palace the why science can only tell us what happened they can't tell us why and the reason I wrote this book it's in two parts the first part is sharing this science in it in lay terms that all of the references all the research is is in thirty pages of documentation people want that number at first part of a book the second part George we've had this for two hundred thousand years and if these mutations are not accidental if they are intentional it applies implies that we are intended to use to embrace these %HESITATION these extraordinary capacities that we have this control that leaves us so far beyond where we are today we're just scratching the surface and when we do that we begin to think of ourselves differently and that the ideas of conflict and struggle to come from the fear become obsolete and we've we've seen that in the past that's why I think this is important bring all this together now when the world is you know anything that we do right now to try to fix these problems a bandaid until we get to the real root of the problem and it comes down to the way we think about ourselves there's a new human story and I'm doing my very best to share factual honest truthful peer reviewed science so that we know what that story is and what's not true we can forget about the stuff we know that is true let's embrace it and that and move forward is and that's why I think it's so exciting Greg the late Zacharias Itchen believes that in extraterrestrial race came here and genetically modified whatever species might about on the planet to make cool we are now what do you think of that we know when I'm sharing it with live audiences to the question people ask okay well where did these modifications come from it depends on who you ask George because the Sumerians I toured with which in in the nineties we toured on a conference or a circuit together or not and always work very well a lot of respect for his work %HESITATION Sumerians had their story beach an addiction had their story %HESITATION that into novel at their story the Hopi have their story the Hindus have there there is some overlap reality aboriginal have their story out and the overlap is that in every one of these indigenous stories there's an intervention of some kind %HESITATION and that we are related to the cosmos what the science is telling us is is our physical bodies have just talked about this yesterday our physical bodies in composition we are closer in composition to the dust it comes from the stars then we are from the earth under our feet into chemical in the terms of the ratios and proportions of the elements so there is a universal thing that says well we are related the something much more to something greater and almost universally the the indigenous traditions say that we have had an intervention but the science is beginning to Baptist Georgian it's not just one discovery their discovery of just down improve Caracas skulls and I I know you've talked about those on yes for there been a new discoveries now in %HESITATION in Central America %HESITATION their discoveries in parts of the U. S. they're telling the same thing when they do the DNA analysis form the fossilized in some cases the mummified remains what they're finding is that the the female component of the DNA is usually are called the believe half haploid the aircraft would be the female is Mesoamerican or from the Andean traditions but the male DNA has no counterpart in the national institutes of %HESITATION of health data base that the DNA cannot be identified with any DNA that we have any records of %HESITATION as of the present time %HESITATION and we don't know where that DNA come from it appears to be something beyond what we see is modern human DNA the females are human the mail we don't know so beast phospholipids it was a one off I would say maybe it's an anomaly but this is where the big picture comes and we begin to look at these discoveries and you know Georgia's interesting a lot happened it's like all of a sudden last for five years construction sites %HESITATION you know are archaeological teams looking for one thing find something solid something else yeah yeah but all this stuff is coming up and when you begin to put it all together the anomalies what used to be called anomalies are beginning there are so many of them their beginnings holiday story and the science now the DNA analysis that we will have the last few years is telling us that what we saw in the past simply isn't true or something happened in the past and there's been some kind of an intervention in we carry that in our bodies it is given us this extraordinary ability to self regulate %HESITATION and Tim to master abilities that we thought were reserved for mystics and yogis and you know at that we have to go on a mountain top halfway around the world and leave everything you love and that certainly is not true you can but you can do this stuff in your living room it's about embracing the deep truth of our existence and I can't think of a better time to do that because as we begin to think of ourselves differently begins we begin to think of our relationships well it's a perfect time to do a Greg we're gonna come back talk more about your work human by design and we'll take some phone calls next ||||||||||| from the heartland of America and the gateway to the west good morning good evening where ever you may be across the nation around the world I'm George Dorian welcome to coast go stay and later on tonight but talk a little bit about intuition here's what's happening now my intuition right now tells me things are too well with Korea that's for sure I plan to assassinate Kim Jon owned and preparations for a potential nuclear showdown with North Korea or among the trove of south Korean military documents reportedly stolen by north Korean hackers south Korea's defense ministry did not comment on the alleged attack which reportedly occurred in September of two thousand sixteen but was only revealed just recently by a lawmaker in South Korea the hack consisted of two hundred and thirty five gigabytes of military documents and about eighty percent of what was stolen has not even been identified yet the university of Hawaii students reportedly opened up their in box divided email headlined in the event of a nuke attack an ominous message sent as North Korea continues to threaten a missile attack on the United States the email the students and faculty members gave instructions to shelter in place if a nuclear or ballistic missile attack by Kim jong-un's regime did our current watch chicken with doctor John Curtis online columnist dot com for his reaction to everything that's going on today John what do you think well you know you had %HESITATION defense secretary matters of speaking to a convention today army convention saying that she is %HESITATION into it I'm forming the army all of deja status of command that they must be ready for a military option and there's a report out now a one of the reasons that links are North Korea and Iran together is a report George that's very curious of a North Korea opening an embassy in Tehran and detailed collaboration going on between the missile technology that north Korea's developed and your radiance and so I think now that what you're looking at with north and Korea and Iran is been linked and I think that they're both those countries are %HESITATION bout plotting basically to conspire against the United States you don't John also those reports that Iran has not stopped its new program at all but continues to move ahead well that's exactly why on two fronts %HESITATION trump will not do it if you will not cancel the %HESITATION %HESITATION the %HESITATION Iran nuke deal what he'll do is chill decertified because I ran the is %HESITATION and I in noncompliance not allowing I. E. A. inspectors into their military sites where it is conceivable that that is not only the other nuclear militarized thing the uranium enrichment has gone on but the work on %HESITATION I nuclear you know on a nuclear did a design has continued so yes the Iran nuke deal is is not in compliance and now that there is collaboration with North Korea I think this situation is deteriorating rapidly yeah I think John that yes there is one more missile test you either toward Japan or toward the United States as Charles R. Smith thinks it could happen soon we're gonna have all heck breaks loose well I think so but I think you people need to realize that as far as like World War three breaking out there's very little support that North Korea has other than a rogue nations like Iran China really are considers North Korea nuisance %HESITATION Vlada Bostock as you know is very close to the north Korean and a Russian border so they're very concerned about any fallout from any kind of a military confrontation but the real issue for China is the reunification of attempted reunification by the south Koreans and United States they've already been informed that that will not happen under any kind of a scenario military attack on North Korea and that it will in all likelihood the Chinese would wind up a serving is a custodial government so you could stabilize that country so for the folks out there screaming this is World War three in the making tell me who the players are in the World War because it's not gonna be Russia it's not gonna be China and it's not gonna be any other regime that we know of maybe around our John thank you doctor John Gerdes is website on Nightline columnist dot com a vampire scare in Malawi in Africa was reportedly responsible for mob violence that's resulted in the deaths of at least five people prompting the United Nations to pull its entire staff in the area the eruption of vampire driven vigilante violence in the African nation came after rumors surfaced back in September that real life blood suckers were creating all kinds of problems these reports prompted the formation of Lynch mobs who've accuse people of being vampires new fingerprint technology that can profile criminals lifestyle could soon be admissible in court it's capable of detecting traces of drugs blood alcohol here cleaning products other substitute substances of forensic interest according to researchers that could help investigators learn more about a criminal's activities just from a single fingerprint well they say the US economy continues to war as a matter of fact the latest C. N. B. C. economic survey shows optimism in the American economy at a ten year high the manufacturing activity is at a thirteen year high service sector activity is at a twelve year high there are record six point two million open jobs in America in semi truck sales are out of control strong right now let's check in with registered investment adviser mission Michael shut lock here mish do you agree with all of this I don't think I do George and I don't think you do and I don't think listeners do either %HESITATION the last jobs report well they %HESITATION I was really in the mix we can blame that on the hurricanes but also we can blame on the hurricanes %HESITATION the ramping up because production to %HESITATION restock the dealer's lot we had hundreds and hundreds of thousands of cars that were flooded and and damaged in those her canes a lot of the manufacturing activity we see is is related to that I think we're in for a very deflationary set up George I'm looking at demographics the largest age group in order in the U. S. twenty six year olds followed by twenty seven twenty five and twenty four user millennials there that they're trapped in debt marketers are trying to figure out how to advertise to the group spending from the boomers were retiring is gonna be tapering off it's it's a when this asset bubble bursts it's going to be a very very deflationary set up things always look good George at the top I've said this before they look good at the top of the housing bubble they look good in two thousand right before the dot com bubble burst I think we're in for another round of that George %HESITATION Boyce thanks Misha Preciado the video was popped up on you too which purportedly shows a UFO zigzag stone volcano the call the era the choppy video which is more than three minutes in length appears to show a metallic object in the sky a bright light emerges from the object for a few seconds it's amazing talking about Yellowstone in that cold there are poor if nothing ever goes what a mess we're gonna have so we're gonna bring up in a moment Catherine miles her latest work is called quake land on the road to America's next devastating earthquake Catherine is next on coast to coast AM and welcome back to coach to coach George o'leary with you so what do you think the next major earthquake might be Los Angeles San Francisco's somewhere around the new madrick fault well well well Catherine miles back with us her latest work is called quake land on the road to America's next devastating earthquake Catherine currently serves as a writer in residence for the green mountain college in as a faculty member for Chatham university she has a bachelor of arts in philosophy from Saint Louis University received her PhD in English from the university of Delaware and dedicate your life to uncovering previously ignored narratives and characters is the author of a book week header on by three years ago called superstorm nine days inside hurricane sandy Catherine welcome back yeah I heard at least three years of gone by way too fast so I'm in Saint Louis right now I'm gonna head back to Los Angeles next week but I'm doing my shows here and around Saint Louis you is a great great university well I can do you all the way all the work for you from Saint Louis or just ended up going to school there I'm from central Illinois originally and then went to school there and %HESITATION you know we I remember really vividly doing earthquake drills to get ready for the next one oh yeah it's right on that salt a big fault indeed tell me a little bit Brockway claimed sure so that this is a road trip around America %HESITATION looking at might make hazard looking at some of that the wild and crazy and super smart other scientists who are trying to figure out how our earth works %HESITATION and looking at my neck rescue and what we've done to prepare for it what we still need to do up looking at some of the ways some of the really wild ways I think that we set off for earthquakes around the country around the world really in the way in which humans are really changing the face her eyes Macau heard around the world let's talk science for just a second why do earthquakes for what happens so there are a variety of different reasons why earthquakes happen though that I sort of like it here a %HESITATION you know sort of if you fill up a water balloon too fast %HESITATION and eventually explode knew what you have is you have that in our case that that was the water in that balloon is building pressure %HESITATION I had a weakness in the earth they can be because %HESITATION to wait are moving against each other either side by side are one moving under another and they can because that weaknesses there %HESITATION and the pressure is changing around it for very different reasons so what's happening is is that pressure becomes too much and it forces the wheat area in in the planet at fault if you well yeah on together basically and that sort of lurches as a result of that that pressure and not that lurch send out %HESITATION waves seismic waves and if you think of for instance growing a lot or our branches moving into water and you kind of imagine those rings that would throw out as a result and that's the sort of cynical and fact into the subject that's happening and why it is that we see all the damage in the shaking after it occurs after we just saw the tragedy in Mexico City with that earthquake a it just amazing what happens when mother nature decides to rumble are in and %HESITATION I know some people who of course still remember the Northridge quake in California now several years ago as well these are big and I'm not sure even though they say a lot of our buildings of that they have now are earthquake proof I'm not sure they are what you think yeah yeah you know I mean building code really had a complicated issue issue in the country we need to be working a lot more out you know and pound for pound there is no more powerful natural disaster then then earthquake you know and and in seconds an earthquake can do I I you know frankly a lot more significant damage then you know even the worse the hurricanes one of the things that really surprised me researching this book is just how little even the best scientists know about how they start why they start where they start on that so that's part of what makes them so deadly terrorist that at this point we're not able to protect them %HESITATION were not able to forecast them our country doesn't have an early warning system unlike other countries like Mexico and Japan so we can't even get folks that thirty seconds forty five second warning that some other you can make a difference Kathryn that the thirty or forty seconds absolutely absolutely we saw that in Mexico you know and and I doubted this a lot but I I you know at the time out at the rest of California Berkeley which is the other side of that either real locus where a lot of this research and happy and they have a beta early warning program out there %HESITATION Congress hasn't yet funded it as a national program %HESITATION but the technology is available on their using a parent you know it I doubt it that way how can you really do in thirty seconds but you know we practice than in thirty seconds you can grab your kid out of bed you can grab your go bag you can get under a table at the household level at the community level you can stop a train you can divert a plane that's about to land you can shut down the tunnel on and and really those Christmas things can actually be the difference between life and that there are hundreds if not thousands of people of okay so you got involved in this in a big way and you traveled everywhere checking and we'll talk about that you've been all over the place what was it that really piqued your interest what surprised me more than anything with this notion of and use seismicity this way in which we set off earthquakes in some of your listeners are probably familiar with what's happening in Oklahoma %HESITATION huge state of earthquake that they're saying they're the result of wastewater injection relating task tracking and oil extraction and that's certainly I think the most newsworthy way in terms of what the media uncovering lightly but as it turned out we set our offers great for all kinds of different ways right now when we built the Hoover dam in the decade that followed %HESITATION the filling of the reservoir behind the dam set off something like ten thousand earthquakes without a mobster mining building tunnels %HESITATION building even high rise buildings can suffer earthquakes %HESITATION the US military set up quite a few earthquakes nineteen sixties trying to inject %HESITATION waste from our chemical weapons program in Colorado into his understanding that that through technology through our activities we have the ability to really change the face of seismic how there is and I think recognizing that and recognizing that added %HESITATION risk but that poses %HESITATION and the fact that that not only you know can we change the weather change a crime that we can also change the very planet and understanding the responsibility that comes unless you get a view a lot of people engineers construction experts scientists what kind of things did you talk with them about when you put the book quake clan together in the any stories %HESITATION pop up on your mind and they are absolutely heroic the scientists are doing this research it's it's incredibly frustrating research on you know some of them have never even experienced an earthquake did you know that if they want to but it's the kind I have felt good just by being in the Midwest and living in LA sometimes to us some rumbles little ones but you know three's three point four something like that but I've never felt the big one but tell us about the scientists and engineers yeah you know and they're doing really great really difficult work when you think about it you know and an earthquake occurs they five miles underground or some cases thirty miles underground %HESITATION and so it's not like you can get down there and actually see what's happening you know the way this was sort of like %HESITATION being an astrophysicist who is trying to talk about dark matter things that are so far beyond the spectrum of our sensory perception that %HESITATION you know it's really difficult but they're doing really great work %HESITATION they were incredibly selfless in terms of allowing me in our last %HESITATION allowing need that you know crawl around the turbines of the Hoover dam aren't the subways in New York and and does a really great experience for me as a classic participatory journalism to get to spend days with with these folks and and kind of see see what they do see what they're doing try to save us and and frankly starts at the a little bit of a window into how our planet works are they concerned at all about a big one happening absolutely and and one of the stress in the bug is I think we all have a tendency to sort of feel like an earthquake in the California problems and and it is a California problem then and you know that the greatest thing approaching certainty that we have is that there will be you know a significant earthquake in southern California probably in our lifetime that plaintiffs are in pretty much close you know that not total agreement on the chance of that as you know ninety five ninety nine percent right so you know those are odd you never see in science but but but that's not the only place where where an earthquake as possible and as a joke in the book you must you live in Miami you really are out a potential risk for an earthquake in and this includes major metropolitan centers lake New York City which is about forty years overdue for an earthquake other Pacific Northwest mentor student Lewis %HESITATION Washington DC you know places that we don't necessarily equate with %HESITATION earthquake possibilities in as you mentioned earlier you know don't really have the building codes %HESITATION in place let alone the sort of emergency management plan and manage that if it if it is going to occur how important in your opinion gravitational pulls from full moons and new moons in very interesting and that's something that scientists are certainly been looking into %HESITATION they're a little bit divided in terms of just how powerful that is in terms of the ability to set off earthquakes and there is some evidence that that of the current %HESITATION but the problem is is that because we don't know where that next quake is going to happen it's really hard to get things like the monitoring stations and things in place there %HESITATION and so right now there's a lot of speculation that Lana hypotheses about what exactly causes them %HESITATION one thing we do know is that water is intrinsically related to a lot of these quakes you'll see an earthquake happened in se Idaho and %HESITATION water table levels so well level well be affected to places like Hawaii importer Ricoh on we know that water extraction on you know our water injection can really change that as well and shouts fracking that in mind fracking can do this too absolutely absolutely and that's something that we've seen especially in places like Alberta on the scene %HESITATION and off the coast of California in the nineteen thirties nineteen forties without oil extraction out there causing earthquakes there as well to set you know anytime we're changing the pressure inside the earth out whether you know were increasing not decreasing that's our activities we have the potential to have that pressure you know reach a week placed a fault in the American soccer quake and Catherine lie even though you said Florida is a somewhat immune from an earthquake they of course get hit by hurricanes you can't get away from mother nature can you you cannot you know and even though you know a hurricane in earthquake even though the actual event looks very different what we've seen if you look at current quarter recall right now in Mexico right now yeah that's right frankly we think that the attacks are very very similar absolutely devastation all the way Catherine stay with us we're going to take a quick break we'll come back and talk more about your work quake clan in the next hour we'll open up the phone lines with you on coast to coast AM well the coast to coast October trivia contest is rolling along now to those of you who don't know what it is there's a weekly prize every week five hundred dollars to the winner who gets the most questions right and then what happens we give you a brand new set of questions every day Monday through Friday if you're right you get your name put into literally a hat and then they'll be a drawing at the end of the week with all the winning entries people have got the question right for the five hundred dollars I'm going to do that in the job winning person every week for the next four weeks in October now all the questions read coast coast am dot com but I'm gonna read one to you here it is according to a recent guest Heidi Hollis which of the following items as the sinister man the hat man not said the where not said the where and a fedora be three piece suit see trench coat D. Rolex watch now for entry info when rules visit coast because they on dot com and for more information you'll see those questions I just thought I gave you and I you know Philip out get the information I hope you're right in the and go for and welcome back to coast to coast Catherine miles with us your book is called quake clans Catherine let's get into some of these stories that there you really found fascinating or frightening from some of the people you talked about what %HESITATION what's out there yeah you know and I think that this idea again of this induced seismicity this idea that that we are literally setting up earthquake but something that I think most %HESITATION Americans certainly I wasn't really aware of as we were and I was researching this book and %HESITATION something really to keep in mind this idea that you know I'm in and this is something that friends miners have known for a hundred years you know they call them rock person you know coal miners have has seen this happen have seen %HESITATION you know friends and co workers injured or even killed by the sort of seismic activity %HESITATION but you know as we're digging deeper and deeper and deeper whether it's for mines whether it's for tunnels %HESITATION builders quick pick any potentially decker right and getting more youngsters in and not just for the people underground but now what we see is the sort of seismic activity has a real impact above ground as well to %HESITATION and so I think that that's really something for us to keep in mind %HESITATION and I think it comes into play in all sorts of different ways both in terms of that the decisions that we make in terms of of the way which we want to use a planet and where we want to build how we want to respond to it and then it comes up I think again also when we're looking at the sort of changing faces seismicity in seismic risk as we consider things like for instance %HESITATION president trump's decision to sort of reinvesting you come out in the nuclear storage there and I think we really have to ask these questions about the real seismic hazard out there what's at risk what shape what we're gonna do about it well we're gonna have to we're gonna have to do that fast now we really don't know all when the big ones gonna happen people have made predictions but we don't know for sure to not at all and and we probably never well you know the country we've invested a lot of money in different sort of predicted studies %HESITATION that was particularly true in nineteen seventy nine nineteen eighty four we really tried hard to be able to invest in understanding how that was going to work out millions and millions and millions of dollars %HESITATION but that has proved elusive what the scientific but prefer the book told me is that it will probably always proved elusive that at best we're going to have that thirty seconds to sixty seconds of warning before the next quake and and so because we don't know when and where on it's really incumbent upon all of us here and be prepared %HESITATION everything from the way which we build our buildings the way in which we set up our community center of our personal responsibility what we're gonna do to make sure that we're safe within the household yeah so why do we seem to be getting stranger sh and weirder storms I mean they just seem unnatural you know it it's such a good question and as if this season eleventh grade anyone well my god gonna look for Armageddon there and they don't stop to you know there's another one after NATO just came through built it they just don't stop and you know that's not hysterically dry we've heard cave we have earthquakes where wildfires you know you really honestly is %HESITATION an exceptional exceptional year and there are some reasons out you know what we do you know in terms of storm %HESITATION intern the hurricane storm is that %HESITATION the ocean is warming and as the oceans warm because a few things happen her teens get more fuel and so they become bigger and stronger %HESITATION they also become harder to predict and they also occurred %HESITATION and and happen last like sort of typical hurricane then that's certainly something that we saw with superstorm sandy where the storm itself was a sort of hybrid storms half nori Sir have her aching %HESITATION we also see things like for instance you know %HESITATION Maria %HESITATION which you know category five just because we don't have a category six you know but but massive storm which are the tremendous flooding %HESITATION earlier this year in places like Houston as well %HESITATION so so what scientists think right now is that %HESITATION it as you know the climate changes as oceans warm at sea levels right we're not necessarily going to see more signs of what we are going to see is more powerful storms greater surge storms behaving and Morris are unpredictable ways %HESITATION and you know as we as we see other things like development as we see things like drought we're gonna see a you know an increase in fires that we see activity like I waste water injection from fracking we're gonna see more earthquakes so so certainly I think that that the onus on the responsibility for it no cleaning some of that really does by what I said and it you know easy to kind of be in Australia to kind of put your head in a stand and say we're not doing that on but that science suggests otherwise where are we with new technology new technology that can help us with preparedness an early warning systems what's out there and there are some fascinating work happening %HESITATION isn't very smart engineers are working on thunderstorm response and buildings buildings that you know just sort of threw smart technology know how to respond whether it's automatically closing storm shutters there whether it %HESITATION being able to sort of way in which to %HESITATION the shaking in a different way some of the most interesting research that I saw when I was like working on the blacklist some crowd sourcing work that's being done kind of participatory citizen science as you well and you know if you think about it you know the way in which we know that things like earthquakes are communists seismometers which had these really tricky touchy little devices they're expensive we don't have a lot of them especially in places away from the west coast and and so it's hard to monitor he's %HESITATION phenomenon and know when they're going to happen and that warning on but what we already have right now our smartphones and and it's like our phone has in it %HESITATION altimeter basically %HESITATION that that that that works kind of like %HESITATION what what it's what decides whether or not that your phone should be in %HESITATION portrait or landscape right so it had it sees the way in which you're moving that I'm gonna know how to respond uses that have used that to look at a picture and had your picture sweat that that technology well let's acknowledge he can distinguish between shaking that %HESITATION you're doing because you're at a dance party or you drop your phone %HESITATION and shaking caused by earthquakes and so so there's a really interesting program coming out of you cal Berkeley right now where they're saying look you know if you'll let us years your location device and then well anonymized it or not you know trying to keep up on you and kind of predict brother here but but if you'll let us kind you that %HESITATION than what we can do ways we consider track the movement and the phone and then when we see that happening because of you know and you know multiple found at the same time we know the next like it's happening on and and her in exchange kind of for using that information and we can also send you off an early morning so if the people five miles from you their phone start shaking first you know that's enough time for us to send you a text that says Hey listen earthquake coming you know take cover and I think that that's a fascinating approach it because you know taxpayers very little money and it al I scientists to do a ton of really interesting work and then it gives the added benefit of %HESITATION early mornings in places like Nepal hugely earthquake active places that don't have those those seismometers emplaced places like New York City Washington %HESITATION you know it really can make a huge difference %HESITATION there was a time were meteorologists we were able to do a better job predicting the outcome of just plain weather patterns what happened it's changed yeah you know and I and I think that a lot of meteorologists would say that they're doing a better job than ever %HESITATION I think that they would say look you know we're actually we're actually getting more sophisticated at our weather satellite technology changes on you so I think that's part of it %HESITATION I think that you know this idea of like a five day forecast as you know works at a comparatively new our forecast system %HESITATION but you know that a couple of things happening you know as a country we have under invested in our %HESITATION sort of what I call I said a metaphoric technology right and I metaphoric infrastructure on so for quite awhile for instance we had our civilian weather satellite program tied to our %HESITATION descent satellite program it was a very sort of awkward relationship %HESITATION and you know when the relationship was finally severed we had a real sort of on satellite deficit and we also had incidently some sort of unfortunate %HESITATION connection that didn't get severed for instance between the computer mainframes and that's part of why we saw that the weather %HESITATION satellite hacked that happened about two years ago and we believe it would actually hackers trying to get into the department of defense real our weather at our civilian weather satellite program %HESITATION so you know reinvesting in not reinvesting technology and certainly we've seen where hurricane tracking that %HESITATION the European model outperform the US model right now because the European Union has decided to invest in that I think it's really a question of you know where our priorities are we willing to invest in the technology that allows is very talented scientist is meteorologist a psychologist to go out and do their work and and get better at say a seven day forecast it better at that early warning system understanding what triggers earthquake so we can have a better sense of of you know where the real risk is on any given day and cancer now when you've scoured the country are looking for possibilities of where earthquakes could hit how many places did you go all and are there some areas that could really severely a be impacted and create problems for us yeah unitarians are unfortunately as is most places right most places have the potential for an earthquake %HESITATION and you know I drove around the country and and what does that leave many places like Canada the yearlong Roach at %HESITATION if you think about that you know for my money you know where where I'm really concerned right now are the population centers you know and we can talk about earthquake in terms of how they're gonna can talk about it in terms of breast cancer and some places are are more likely to see an earthquake so for instance Alaska Hawaii certainly the most likely places to see an earthquake just because of where they fall on our tectonic plates on but you know but the population centers are very small right so so while there's a better chance of an earthquake there the overall effect of that earthquake is is is much smaller than say New York City very much at risk for an earthquake %HESITATION and and even a moderate quake there one that you know you could argue there for years overdue for on that that same quake that could happen and say why only if that happens the to York city on the devastation would be significantly bigger just because of how much we built there is because of how many people there how much literal infrastructure is better and since you've been doing this are have you flown with that of worldwide if we're having the same issues or is it just the United States problem I would guess it's happening all around the planet yeah certainly a worldwide problem then we certainly see these ads are close in terms of earthquake activity but you know I mean I don't I don't think anyone has has forgotten two thousand eleven others to human where disaster %HESITATION you know certainly you know areas that are still evacuated were still really only beginning to understand the real facts of what happened when that that meltdown occurred on you know and understand the potential risk for that you know if we go back this a little bit further to say two thousand four and we think about that incredibly deadly Indian Ocean tsunami and yeah it's absolutely a global problem some countries do better than others back to this idea that early warning system you know Mexico has an early warning system %HESITATION Taiwan Japan some European countries even have these early warning system I'm pathetic countries that have chosen to invest in that and you know it it you know again it's it's it's it's it's it's a simple elegant technology we have in place %HESITATION with set of appropriations from Congress it could be the case right now that every American gets attacks %HESITATION when an earthquake is coming %HESITATION and you know my guess my question would be why wouldn't we do that why wouldn't we invest in something that could save lives on and that that frankly is not all that expensive Dale no it's not but do you predict personally based on where you've been and what you've seen something major happening yeah absolutely in I we can't say when and we tried really hard to be able to say whether that but you know we we do you know %HESITATION that for instance you know if you look at the San Andreas fault known I'm arguably our most famous south sought out a scientist agreed that you know that something as close to certainty as we possibly can have and that there will be a significant earthquake and say southern California quite possibly in our lifetime and we know that based on something called return rate which is looking at a sort of historic occurrence of earthquakes overstay among Linnea and we know that the new madrick fault %HESITATION which in fact a great deal in the Midwest particularly places like Saint Louis and I'm just %HESITATION you know that that that that that a very large earthquake is a very real risk their %HESITATION we don't know when it'll happen it could be tomorrow it could be a three hundred years %HESITATION but when you take a look at a place like mensa you know %HESITATION that doesn't necessarily pop up on most of our sort of personal radar screen does that you know a major problem who said it's not that it's the blueprints barbecue a lot of people don't realize is that meant that it's a lot of ways the commercial %HESITATION hub for our country you know we have FedEx located there we have UPS located there I'll look in Memphis International Airport with something like four million packages moving through Memphis every single night on the needs are everything from corkage Jackson take tax on to your Amazon order and but it's also the U. S. %HESITATION mail service they're the number one the number one sub contractors who use that acts as a delivery system the US military prescription drugs on auto parts all going through that area as we also have one British desoto bridge echoes through Memphis with something like a thirty five percent of all of our trucking commerce on any given day crossing that one bridge in trying to get through that area so you know where a catastrophic earthquake to occur there %HESITATION that the ripple effect for the country would be Marriott and years in the making and obviously that's here for places like washing the New York City as well what about earthquakes at areas of nuclear power plants like Fukushima we've got many in the United States why you know and I I just wrote I wrote an article about this for %HESITATION The Boston Globe and a magazine and then against Marcos tents and you know unfortunately the construction of a nuclear power plant I we often find not very good no you know and and and one of one of the more chilling facts that but that might just be that you're still logical survey shared with me as look you know we have twenty one hundred known fault in this country and we have exponentially more unknown thought that we just haven't discovered yet and we can define them when we build earth when we build nuclear power plants that was that was true with Diablo and in California that was true with some power plants near Washington each and as it turned out Indian point power plants I which is located about twenty miles north of New York City is built pretty much directly on a previously unknown fault called the Ramapo fault and some scientists say that it's capable of are quite large earthquakes say a seven point oh quake %HESITATION which they think would do enough damage set to affect the reactors there %HESITATION even more telling is the fact that Indian point %HESITATION its sister power plant program which is located in %HESITATION Plymouth Massachusetts just outside of Boston it went up to close to %HESITATION in about a seven eight years and so they were actually given a pass by the NRC for some post Fukushima retrofit that would have sort of brought them up has not base you know that after we looked at Fukushima the tsunami and earthquake we said well you know we better get our nuclear power plants under control here as well too they got a pass for some of those restaurants that have not had spoke like the union for consent by ancestor really concerned unless said you know if there's nothing going to get a pass they need clothes right now they don't get to operate for another seven eight years we saw when hurricane Katrina hit Katherine how female just wasn't ready is it ready now it's doing better uniting Katrina was really telling her for a lot of a lot of people that really shared some weaknesses that we have in terms of our first response I think we get better and better and better up with every disaster but I think if you look at for instance quarter Rico right now you know part of the United States %HESITATION you know and trust it's a territory right now Catherine stay with us we're gonna come back and talk more about your work quake land and also we'll take phone calls and if you've been in an earthquake tell us what it was like |||||||||| from the heartland of America and the gateway to the west good morning good evening where ever you may be across the nation around the world I'm George Inori welcome to coast coast AM later on tonight we'll take a look at the paranormal side here's what's happening close call but were okay a house sized asteroid gave birth a near miss tonight passing harmlessly inside the moon's orbit wall giving experts a rare chance to rehearse for a real life strike the space rock will shave past the earth at twenty seven thousand miles we dodged one radiation levels across Europe have risen mysteriously and they say Russia may be behind the baffling phenomenon German scientists say that there's been a slight increase in the amount of particles of an isotope in Germany Italy Austria Switzerland and France higher levels sh they just think maybe something has to do with Russia the United States has conducted a joint military exercises with South Korea flying to strategic bombers over the Korean peninsula and by the way North Korea hacked in the south Korea's military plans as we reported yesterday how did this happen let's check in with the expert on the internet Lauren Weinstein Lauren hunter they do this area whether they're dying of course and and we know that cyber attack go attacker locations are notoriously difficult to pin down but it doesn't make sense for them to do that and and the fact %HESITATION if it's true that South Korea had such weak security on their own on their plans for attacks them and defense is is pretty startling because we all know that Kim based on the whole isn't really his rockets and is it really is nukes it's is conventional weapons into conventional attack to get across the DMZ they could probably launch killing vast numbers of of south Koreans and the Americans are Korea even if the U. S. or some other party launched a devastating attack on North Korea does traditional weapons argh are easy to watch it it's just a few miles to do it so that's the obvious way for North Korea to protect itself the obvious thing that North Korea wants to to know about is how to make that conventional war as a successful as possible and yeah it's getting hold of south Korea's defense plans and their offense offensive plans for conventional war is is just what Kim would want so it's it's baffling really I think that's good as hackers they're apparently very good now whether every attack that we say is from North Korea or that is claimed to be from North Korea actually is from there that we don't know but there's a lot of evidence to suggest that the limited resources that that North Korea has a remember most people in North Korea are essentially slaves it's a slave state it's essentially but the resources that are allocated instead of big allocated to things like food and housing they are allocated to things like cyber attacks and cyberwar alright my friend Lauren thank you so much one Weinstein expert on the internet I'm dead man's unsent text message leaving his home and pension to was brother rather than his wife and son signed off of the smiley faces been ruled legitimate by an Australian court it's as well on a text message the Las Vegas sheriff leading the investigation into America's worst mass shooting has said we may never know what motivated Stephen paddock to kill fifty eight people Joe Lombardo said that an exam of paddocks brain has revealed no abnormalities Wallace girlfriend Mary Lou Dantley had no concerns over his mental health detectives have contacted every branch of paddocks family tree including both his ex wives but have no uncovering of anything that would explain his murderous actions I thought would bring in for a moment Neil Slade he's an expert on the brain one of his books of course called tickle your amygdala Neil this is gonna come down as one of the strangest stories ever I thought originally when this happened the that Sunday night that maybe they should give him an autopsy and look at his brain maybe have a tumor yeah he did nothing wrong with them well there's a couple things I've uncovered one he's was prescribed valium yes and there's a very strong it there's a thing called a paradoxical effect and this is been known about valium which incidentally is the number one prescribed drugs in the United States this is been known since nineteen seventy five out one Canadian study showed that eighty one percent of inmates involved in aggressive incidents had taken valium and they were three almost four times as likely as acts of aggression then those prisoners not taking valium that's one thing another thing is that the type of that psychotic behavior that can result in in then Bob psychotic behavior that can result in very violent acts in and homicides %HESITATION that one area the brain called the medial prefrontal cortex is a very small area of the brain and that kind of %HESITATION defect in brain function wouldn't show up in an autopsy you need to do a functional MRI a brain scan on the living are subject to to see that no that just because they'd be a tumor wasn't president or any gross abnormality doesn't mean that is his brain was functioning properly out one of the things that came to mind to me was %HESITATION thinking about Albert Einstein's brain now they did not start see on Einstein's brain in his brain even though he was responsible for probably the most wide sweeping changes to humanity because of this discovery in physics his brain was virtually normal with with with a very %HESITATION small change possibly in the number of supported real self and very so yeah you can have a very wide range of brain function that cannot be seen in something like a year %HESITATION gross abnormalities such as two more showing up in a an area an autopsy but even even even if there was something wrong with his brain I don't think a lot of people know that it would be a gun regulation that Obama had I have put into place %HESITATION that was repealed by the %HESITATION by Congress in February and that that law would as a pre Bennett people suffering from psychotic disorders in schizophrenia from getting guns and that will was repealed in February so even if there was something mentally wrong with that person or any other person in that in that kind of state they're they're perfectly able to go out and buy as many guns as they they like even though they may be mentally ill now that that law was been repealed interesting take Neil thank you so much great observation well today marks the official launch of the to the stars academy of arts and science and innovative public benefit corporation which will advance research into unexplained phenomenon develop related technology that is established three divisions science aerospace and entertainment it's headed up by company president Tom the long and and of course Tom of the rock group blink one eighty two frame and love with us right now Leslie came to talk about this incredible discovery I guess because this is going to one cover some interesting things will it not Leslie I George well we hope it will I think I'm the company has incredible potential and it's it's formed by these outstanding individuals who have been involved with this issue for a long long time and have a lot of experience a lot of knowledge and a lot of potential so they intended to develop some pretty incredible things and I hope they do Leslie the course is an independent investigative journalist known for pioneering human rights in Burma she has several books out there including surviving death and UFOs generals pilots and government officials go on the record you know Tom has %HESITATION for some time been really trying to get to the bottom of you was fiddling your foes you think he will with this organization yeah I mean I just really take my hat off to him George because he's as he said he's been working hard for years and he's managed to work his way into the very very highest levels and people taken seriously at those levels they trust them and he's put his own resources to forming a company bringing them all together in one place and it's really really an amazing accomplishment and what I think is really significant about that stands out in life I wrote a story about this today is the fact that one of these people was the head of a UFO program within the department of defense he only left that program about eight days ago little use would still continuing you know and Ewing and the point is that we now know that there is such a program this is going to question the people of debated for a long long time you know is there is a secret government program as of today we know that there is a prisoner headed up that program has come out told us that there's a program and told us that because of that program he knows that this phenomenon is real that you oppose exist and that the real and I find that to be extremely significant because he's it's true he's left the department of defense but he was only it's only been eight days since he left is not some guy who's been retired actually you know twenty years and is sitting back in his armchair and it not only was he just recently retired but he actually was the head of this program and the fact that they would even have a program tells you miles it does that they've been saying ever since close the project Bluebook of course that the US government is not interested in this and doesn't so now we know that that's not the case that people have believed for a long time and we've we've we've learned not the case thank you Leslie taught the long will be a future guest on George Knapp's weekend program some watching the website up next LA marginally joins us we're gonna talk about Fatimah miracle of the sun or harbinger of deception next on coast to coast AM and welcome back to coast to coast George going with you we've got a great two hours for your LA marginally with us author lecturer filmmaker he has penned the number of books including the nephilim trilogy and received an honorary doctorate for the series from the Pacific and he has lectured on the subject of your foes ancient prophetic text as well he is a part of the from the incredible watchmen chronicles in those those series his books of course days of chaos on the trail of the nephilim and now we talk about Fatimah LA fascinating subject always interested in this one absolutely record have me on George cruciate my pledge of not you went to Portugal to investigate what happened a hundred years ago you can go a hundred years ago but a path tell me why well I was actually in the midst of making another film and we were in the process of our doing interviews for and I got through a tap on the shoulder one word and it was Fatimah and I just went on my gosh and I just I walked into my wife she was %HESITATION in the other room I said we're going to Fatimah Portugal and the reason why I did that as I felt like we were supposed to go and I didn't realize at the time it was a hundredth year anniversary this year is a hundred year anniversary of what happened no I've been a student of the so called phantom apparitions for for decades and and as you know Rick read many books on the subject from all different angles and and look at it but obviously never had gone to Portugal and so we we put a partially spent two weeks there we interviewed %HESITATION historians and anthropologists we interviewed neuroscientist are people that had had spent decades researching this we went to the site which was overwhelming and we went to other apparition sites and what we discovered sort of cemented what I've what I wrote about actually in politics prophecy in the supernatural ten years ago that it was a harbinger of deception in my opinion and let me just give a carrier before I go any further sure you know millions of people go to Fatimah every year millions of pilgrims millions of of Muslims and circle the Kaaba stone millions of Hindus celebrate Grupo Jr millions of voters %HESITATION worshipper thousand temples all over Asia when the film is not to disparage anyone's belief system that's not what the film is about the film is about the that what happens between may thirteenth nineteen seventy and the startling event in October thirteenth nineteen seventeen which is called the miracle of some which by the way I believe is a misnomer like moths man in nineteen sixty seven sixty eight was was was call that this entity that appeared in Point Pleasant and terrorize people appear to hundreds of people over a period of time was was labeled marksman by a reporter we have no idea what this entity was what his name was it's a misnomer the same thing with the miracle of the sun there was a reporter in fact I'm gonna get away head of myself but I need to kind of give the background story here there was a reporter in the field who wrote the story the following day in a secular which is a major newspaper and Liz that he was the one coined the name miracle of the sun remember when these people are there they have no nothing in their paradigm that is gonna hurt help them put a label on the events that happened but I'm way ahead of the stories I had okay now let's talk let's talk about phantom on it exactly what was the episode that's been reported in that had to do with three children October thirteenth nineteen seventeen saw the apparition of a woman which we believe to be the blessed Mary pick it up from there well this is this is where it goes off the rails when you go back to nineteen seventeen documents which we draw everything from we don't go to the documents %HESITATION from like nineteen twenty eight nineteen thirties the forties fifties there almost to fathom there's the original Fatimah which happen in nineteen seventeen and those documents are hand written by the priest father figure who actually get into a mission for for Meiji go and I know I am I pronouncing that right but he gave them in nineteen twenty three after the actual all the all the witness testimony but they're all written in longhand and we've had access to some of those %HESITATION we draw this from several a book specifically by joking Fernandez and seen that the armada fear passed away twenty fourteen story able to talk to her daughter Fredricka and we were actually in his house filming there with all this just the voluminous research was just absolutely incredible and what what she'd that this story is this that that in nineteen seventy eight Xena was given access to the sanctuary it's bad about these records at the Fatimah sanctuary which by the way can hold one million pilgrims at one time that's how fugitives and when you go there it's breathtaking and we we got there at eight o'clock at night it was on July evening actually July twelfth and and it was just a little bit of wind blowing through the pines soft music playing and it was it was breathtaking and it's absolutely humongous but I digress the bottom line is Sena was given access to the sanctuary Arafat about to these documents to the original records which had been kept in a vault and really no one had looked at them for decades literally so freely gets in there and she discovers things and she's she's not often take any photographs what she does she take a tape recorder in and she reads the transcripts to the tape recorder and she published a book and it was extremely controversial when it came out because it it is it is it's completely different in the story that most of us know first of all you mentioned of that I was married the Bible the original title of the film was married the Bible or a harbinger of deception when we got the farm up up on the twelfth the next day and we did this deliberately was one of the operation days she appeared on the thirteenth of the month from may to October ever every every thirteenth of the month for six months she appeared to these kids or an entity appear so when we got there %HESITATION it was it was overwhelming but the next day all the children showed up and there were thousands of them from all over the world and they have the statue of you know what what they what they believe is married but it doesn't look like a Jewish very Caucasian and that's another story but with a crown on her head on a bed of roses being held up by four pallbearers parading through the square and thousands of people are waving handkerchiefs I turned to my wife and my guidelines that were taken Mary off the table we can't even go there you know and this is why the county at the beginning of the film millions of pilgrims come to Fatimah we're not here to despair they can believe whatever they want to believe people have the right to believe what they want to believe we're concerned with the miracle of the sun but here's the deal what what the records show was that Lucia who was ten years old Francisco who was nine inches center who seven these are very very young children and they are illiterate George they don't read or write there is no schooling their shepherds they tend the cavalry day they sit around in the wintertime it looks from the stories I mean this is this is there their reality their dirt roads there are no airplanes in Portugal in nineteen seventy so these kids or L. tending the sheep and this entity appears and Lucia I was glowing right to record that it's merry she never says that he said it was a lady who said she came from the sky and it was glowing work right it was it was very vibrant it was brighter than the sun %HESITATION it was sort of amorphous %HESITATION she could only make out certain features she never saw the entities hair what was very troubling and this was troubling to both the parish priest and %HESITATION the bishop of who %HESITATION who when because when the chair and just census said that she was wearing a skirt that fell just below the knees this was this was prostitutes that didn't look like that in nineteen seventeen I mean women wore ankle ankles you know dresses that right to be enforcing never shoulder Laos not that's that's what it was and the fact that this and Lucia just center said that the entity whatever this that was had a short skirt who is a skirt that fell just below the knee that's weird I never knew that remotely controversial extremely coach yeah that is in the original documents this object that apparently came in front of the sun was witnessed by how many people well this is what happens for may thirteenth when they open the apparition appears no one is there just the three children right by the way is the fourth witness we can get into that later who went under the radar for decades until fina founder but that's another side story but she also had an encounter with another being with blonde hair by the same tree who communicated with her telepathic which and this this woman Carolina Currier wasn't sure there's a boy or girl about eight years old and she was being communicated with voiced a skull telepathic which so and that's like just slightly before the operations began and these apparitions happen may thirteenth so by June is a few people who are gathered on the thirteenth because Lucia form of the body that this entity in this this whatever it was this woman this lady it's gonna return on the thirteenth alright hold on we'll get to that return date when we come back right here on coast to coast area and we will return in a moment to talk with the LA Mars Julie about Fatimah miracle of the song or harbinger of deception great story will take your calls with him next hours well as you know this month we are having our trivia question and there's a new service of questions every day there's a drawing at the end of the week for five hundred dollars if you get one or all five during the week of these questions right you get one to five entries for that five hundred dollars so enter as often as you can that's all it coast to coast AM dot com however I do read the questions to so let me read this to you I close asteroid flyby has sparked apocalyptic warnings of which anniversary occurring near this time a the fiftieth anniversary of **** harbour UFO case be the hundredth anniversary of the Marian apparition at fat among see the hundredth birthday of JFK D. the twentieth anniversary of the nineteen eighty nine San Francisco earthquake for entry info on roles visit coast to coast AM dot com welcome back to coast to coast only marginally with us for talking about fat amok in that incredible story that occurred a hundred years ago allies we were talking about this the story of the song and how many people witnessed this when you were telling us that there are a number people came back around June of nineteen second of eighteen seventeen tell us what happened well it ensuring there was a handful of people that gathered there and yes he showed up again was interesting only the children could see here only loose here and just center and Francisco could see the entity always Lucy and just center could hear her speak Francisco was not able to she saw the entity but never heard her speak it was always voices call is always telepathic so in July of the crowd was swelling %HESITATION and not to late nineteen seventy nine I just sent a team to separate the crowd a swelling in July and it becomes extremely controversial of the parish priest father Sierra and it would with interesting your little sidebar quickly that's Sierra always believe right from the get go that the whole thing was demonic did not believe that what whatever was going on was Mary the Bible %HESITATION and he was he was a controversial figure so when he gave his report after an exhaustive study in talking to witnesses everything else and this is the report from nineteen seventeen handwritten witnesses from may to October thirteenth he goes missing George he falls off the face of the earth no one knows what happens to the guy and we're actually trying to find out what happened to him did he have a family you know like a mother and father because of brother sister we're trying to track it down because that's a story in itself that's never been told he absolutely vanishes from history but I digress so here's the deal in September this whole thing is getting controversial that the parish priest is up in arms about the bishop the magistrates and destroying all these crowds and Lucia never says it's Mary she says it's a lady and when she asked where he cut where did you come from she pointed to the sky that's all in the nineteen seventeen documents uncovered by fear the armada in their book Joachim Fernandez via the Ammar celestial lights heavily lights and and their incredible blocks if you wanna %HESITATION if you you know people want to get them we interviewed Jo came army comes on the record in the film so in September they told the kids the magistrates in the previous they say go back to this entity this lady and after we need a sign we need something to to show that this is real so the kids go back and they say look you know we need a sign and the and the other two thousand come on on October thirteenth and there will be a sign so word spreads like wildfire through poor and if they do not social media and those those people don't realize it in nineteen seventeen there are no cellphones the cameras that they have a wooden boxes with glass plate much right that's what we're looking at there are no airplanes in Portugal maybe one in Lisbon probably ninety nine percent of people in that field that they have never seen any type of aerial phenomena at all nothing they've never seen an object it other than a bird in the sky so when that when what was that I'm getting ahead of myself here board finally manifest it shocking and there's no paradigm overseas people can embrace it soap seventy thousand people gather in the field at Fatimah they are waiting beside the kids over there in the seventy thousand people touch you chop the that's that's a that's a big football stadium so huge crowd it's a huge crowd and we've got pictures which we actually black and white photos which we show in the film they are the original photographs which we had access to we show those in the film and you can see it's a sea of umbrellas it's been raining all morning long from from the wee hours of the morning like late night in the wee hours of the morning all through the morning there's a sea of umbrellas people are basically so they aren't wet to the bone so it one o'clock %HESITATION that the kids are very buddies waiting for this thing it's both happen at noon it doesn't it's an hour late at one o'clock this the clouds parted the sun comes out and everyone's really because it's finally stops raining well and this is where those of you who are coast insiders revolution the show for decades no that clouds can often hide objects and and in the end and Fatimah to which is the sequel to the film we interview chase clock ski who's a UFO investigator and a good one and a good one to chase that I've been in the field together you know numerous times now and and we and she comes on the record and I ask about the clouds I mean I know about them but I want someone else to talk about it and and we know that that clouds can be used to hide the craft and somehow these objects these these are these are %HESITATION craft can create the clouds so what happens in Fatimah a hundred years ago the clouds part disorders there people looking at the sun the relieved that it's not raining but people are still flock to the bone then a cloud goes in front of the sun and all of this cloud this is all from the nineteen seventeen documents I'm not making that up it's the hand written testimonies something an object comes out of the clouds and it begins to spin on it like an access and it's doing this George it's throwing out all these colors over the crowd and everyone is completely be dazzled by what they're looking at I mean look at you and I were standing in there and that field will be going all my gosh what is a site which is that one who reported that in the paper as the sun came down well this is the deal and I'll talk about that in just a second alright so it's spinning and then like a leaf it begins to fall to the ground like a leaf motion or a center like a fat will be heard that performance classic in ufology especially with that this craft were they when they come to earth they they dissent in this like leaf like patterned we've heard this for decades soap and then it goes back up it does this times before it does what we call the fly by this object flies over the crowd less than a hundred feet now remember you're standing in a crowd most of the people are real literate they can't rewrite that's right never seen an aircraft they've never seen a plane they've never seen one in the sky okay all they see is the sun the moon things like that Agnes fame comes out of a cloud and poses to crowded though the fly by people are freaked out there's a there's a priest who we actually show the film but just as quickly look where he was a child standing in that field and now he's like an older manage our priest probably in his late sixties early seventies I'm not sure but that's what he looks like to me and he's very emotional he talks about this is what he says verbatim this is the translation furred desiccated the desk well Hordern tan color and then descended solo that we thought it was when it was going to crush us now all that's real when I get that I was buzzed by up a says no I like thirty five years ago I was walking on the beach in Malibu with my dad and I heard this this really weird Sarah or was it got Wyrick look behind me and it's like you know I I know where is instantly centerplate listeners know but George's things like maybe sixty feet above the beach and I grab my data we both hit that hit the sand as this thing we were terrified and we knew it was we were terrified something that low moving next fare overhead it's just it's unbelievable so there are lawyers in the field a few lawyers medical doctors there are men of letters they do come on the record not everyone comes on the record but some some people do and this is what we hear this is from a lawyer I looked up and saw a doll silver desk and the word doll silver and desk is used by multiple witnesses that's amazing over and over and over in my T. object have come down LA to cloak the sun so those people who were really warrant in the know might have thought it was the son this is what I think I think that people were so blown away there was nothing in their paradigm to to deal with that no nothing to compare nothing nothing to comparative so the newspaper guy who writes the story calls it the miracle of the sun but %HESITATION and this week we interviewed this guy %HESITATION for the film is just a brilliant man and and he plotted the fly by in in the where the witnesses were and and and talks about the different phenomenon that these people felt from the drying of the close to skin burns to the buzzing in the air as a means of all all you you know you FOR a lot I mean that's what you have but but he talks about if the sun is the size of a watermelon and the earth is the size of the head of a match there is no way that the sun we came out of its place in the sewer system and descended to know we all cried that we know we know so it wasn't the sun and everybody on earth and other places would've known that it was not beside it was something else is a misnomer that's why use moth man but it's a great example I know most of your listeners know who years so I don't think you know go through a thirty minute X. explanation I can do the shorthand marshmallows a misnomer no one knows what the entity really call what what it was no one knows who was given that name by a reporter in the same way honeyeaters ago Fatimah Portugal a reporter calls it the miracle of the sun this is been repeated literally millions and millions and millions of times up to the present day but when you go back to the nineteen seventeen records and you listen to what the witness testimony say it's not the sun it's a silver disk some people describe it as a a bright metallic object others call it an orb depending on where you are in the field you're gonna have a different vantage point and we know that witnesses will never say the same thing you know they they use different words to describe what they're saying but the phenomenon is completely outside the realm of anyone's parents so they have no nothing in which to relate it to and that's what I call any member in nineteen seventeen that that the words that we know and had everyone who's listening on the show no you up close flying saucers that is not a lexicon that won't happen for decades later so there's there's no word that you UFO flying saucer so they're calling it a dull silver disc what does that sound like to you well it sounds like some kind of craft absolutely LA what about the three secrets to fathom on that apparently that the even the the late father Malachi Martin discussed these three secrets what were they did they come up at all in the US where critter stringers and and we didn't we didn't delve into it I I I and I even fathom the two the sequel I will I will I'll I'll tell you what but I think based on the research this is what happens to Lucia it did the other two seniors just center dies first %HESITATION she's like nine years old she dies as a child very charge only nine years old she was seven when she saw the entity two years later he died of influenza Francisco same thing he succumbs to influenza shortly thereafter he never reaches his his you know teenagers so we have one fear of its left and Shia that set at eighteen years old she puzzle up by the Jesuits to a convent and given a valve silence most people don't know that so in the in the quiet her up absolutely and nineteen twenty eight this is eleven years after the events okay nineteen twenty eight she writes her memoirs she writes about the first and second secret there is no mention him in nineteen seventeen documents and people can take issue with this go back to even nineteen seventeen documents if it was so important why didn't she talks she never mentioned Russia there are no secrets it's not very George it's not there but the bottom line is this this is why wasn't made up by the church well I don't I don't want to go there but yeah look you gonna have to if I ask you not now you gonna get some calls about that alley next hour you know that I know that it's very controversial and again we're not I might here trying to disparage anyone's belief if someone wants to believe that it was Mary the Bible more power to you what went in and none of this negates the belief of god no court look you as you know I mean I mean I'm a I'm a believer I mean I him but I'm also a Frank supernatural list and the bottom line is just because we see something or just because we encounter something we have no idea whether it's benevolent or malevolent can we conclude that on that date in October of nineteen seventeen something dramatic happens to these three children there is no doubt that something something something they are of a phenomenon happen that was incredible and then from that the drying of the clothes the buzzing in the years George %HESITATION they don't they didn't make the story on the windshields of cars exploded the car motor wouldn't wouldn't start gasoline spontaneously combusted all that is been removed from the official story that we now dead batteries were clocked absolutely nature is just like modern ufology the cars wouldn't start people had radiation burns people had burns on their skin yeah I'm thinking of Richard Dreyfuss in close encounters exactly or the or the cash Landrum yeah it's so all right there in the nineteen seventy knocked him why I gotta ask you this why would the church create this as more of a spiritual religious event rather than an extraterrestrial about thank you seventeen is very complex you've got the in Portugal you've got the arm the first Republic being formed World War one is raging the Bolsheviks were about to overtake Russia you got the Balfour declaration that is being foisted up in the halls of power in Great Britain it's a very tumultuous controversial time when Lucia writes the memoirs in twenty eight she talks about consecrating Russia to the Sacred Heart of Mary in my opinion in my humble opinion this is a confabulation %HESITATION you know Russia was never mentioned in the nineteen seventy documents and the reason why this is there is because everyone on the planet hidden by nineteen twenty eight is absolutely terrified of the Bolsheviks I mean look what Hitler did Hitler blamed everything either on the Jews are the communist and that was that's what nine that's what was going on from nineteen seventeen onward that's what you know that and next that's why I think this story was manipulated look which she had a gag order you know basically a vow of silence at the gag order if she lived to impede pretty golden shake Garnett thinking and two thousand four two thousand yeah yeah yeah I remember just when the program when it was introduced cardinal Ratzinger pope Benedict when he was a staunch believer in an American operation specifically Fatimah and he distanced himself in his pontificate from any said I I mean I got the quote he says well Fatimah was for another time meanwhile the new pope Francis is as a as a staunch believer it so something happens in in nineteen seventy nine actually show our instrument to clips from a journey the two thousand and nine %HESITATION apparition over the Coptic church in Egypt which is just for blobs of white George that's all they are yeah and everybody's you know freaking out clapping hands muscles are Christians and together no one's rebuke in this thing don't stick in the authority no one's challenging it they're always going to be married the Bible why because how do you know that it's for blobs of light same thing not Ireland the solos pulsating but it's something in front of the sun which is causing this to do that I mean it's not the sun that's pulsating because this is a regional system is one area so something is is some there's some sort of atmospheric the students which is happening and you should hear the people it's that we they're just going absolutely bonkers everyone just accept this is a miracle not so fast citizen and I'm a French supernatural is you know that we are told in the guidebook was supernatural to test the spirits that's what we're admonished to do just because something appears in the room I don't know whether it's benevolent or malevolent how how the heck am I don't you don't know we don't know additionally absolutely Gattaca and testing anything there we're gonna take this break LA we're gonna come back I got more questions of course you're gonna get flooded with phone calls here I want to know if there's any tie in between the Ezekiel's wheel that they talk about the Bible and this situation as well and are much more when we come back on coast to coast AM
