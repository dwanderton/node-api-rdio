welcome to today's edition of bulrush twenty four seven podcast alright folks rex tellers and says he's not going anywhere to drive bys I've been hoping it till arson was going to resign because there was a rumor out there that television called the trouble moron this past summer and since they all think drums a moron that ink doesn't have a say at tellers and came out behind closed doors today is that I'm not going anywhere I fully support to trump agenda I'm committed to it I'm staying right here and I'm not commenting on your stupid moron story so now they're all in a Twitter here about what does this really mean is leaving anyway greetings folks right to have your Rush Limbaugh and de the EIB network or already Wednesday I was trying to think here I can't believe how quickly things are going by fast as we can maybe if after three hours telephone number eight hundred two eight two two eight eight two and the email address a rush won't EIB net dot com or going to activate the fourth hour today for subscribers that Rush Limbaugh dot com if you were here listing of the end of the program yesterday I'm I opened up and I shared frustrations with the with the audience there's so much here but I'm not getting to and any and and and normal cycle went out duh events happening that require a lot of time such as the Las Vegas massacre I probably would have gotten most of these events a handle and what I mean by that is discussed them %HESITATION offered my salient thoughts and opinions I and there might keeping my pledge to keep people informed and knowledgeable and that stack of things that I haven't had time to get to is growing and growing and growing and I finally figured out that I'm not gonna get to any of it died that that three hours here on the broadcast this simply isn't enough time to get to it everything I want to talk about so we have an option for that we haven't done this in a long time that's why didn't activated yesterday with his cocoa in the gang need to set things up to handle a possible data Louise %HESITATION via a blog and so we're ready to go today if you're a subscriber and Rush Limbaugh dot com just logging and %HESITATION as you would normally do during the three hours and will either have a a fourth hour button to click on are the dental Campbell keep you there I'll find out exactly how we're going to identify on the website so you can easily find it its commercial free and it goes until I'm ready to stop %HESITATION there are no breaks there are phone calls fellow if you're on hold when the programs over you can choose to stay there if you wish I guess we'll try to get phone calls and I I guess I need to get through some of the stuff and they up the fourth hour is not one of the Tom added benefits that so subscribers Rush Limbaugh dot com get out but we never commit to doing one every so often it's just when I feel like it one is necessary it's been too long there hasn't been one in a long time and the primary reason is I haven't seen the need are in in order to get to everything but that need is obvious today there's all kinds of great stuff that %HESITATION if if I didn't mention that you would even know and you couldn't hold it against me %HESITATION there's old is old adage when I was a disc jockey you know playlists were very tight they they program directors at music radio stations were just paranoid of playing a song that would cause people to tune out and that's why playlists for tightening images many places I work the current hit playlist was no more than twenty four songs and the number one song in town had to be played every seventy minutes all of this was market research the DJs were robots %HESITATION after all after a fashion and a song would come along that maybe was borderline we go to the program Greg you gotta put this in a less you gotta put this it's great not not not not gonna do it nobody will ever know if we don't play it so we can't be hurt by not played the theory was if you don't play it nobody can turn out when you go because you're not and I'll never know you're not playing it because nobody listens twenty four seven what's kinda like that with this new stuff if I don't talk about it and don't do it you know even know about it you're not sure that I never got to it but see I blew that yesterday by telling you all these things I haven't gone to so now I'm committed to get into that but I want to fox there's no guilt attached to this %HESITATION I've been looking forward to it ever since I decided to do it I'll give you a couple of it's

can watch and listen to it again or whenever you like yeah job it's going to be fun alright the Las Vegas massacre our has now reached the full politicization of Dayton as a motive continues to be effusive there are people however who don't think the motive is if you've seen there are people who think the motive is not one and because it's not preferred by certain personages and affiliation is that it is not being announced and one of the their tool on going theories of motivation that I have been able to determine RV quote unquote most popular one of them is that the guy is in fact the never Trumper or that his girlfriend is a lot a mysterious illness learned mystery about this band things that been alluded to about her that still remain not nailed down such as that she is highly influential how old great sway over the guy and this herself in a %HESITATION political radical of sorts or knows people who are so one of the theories is that %HESITATION this guy was targeting trump supporters and with the %HESITATION prejudicial belief that a country western concert would draw and attract mostly trump supporters there are others who believe if and the guy had become radicalized by militant Islam are there is a video out there you remember shortly after trump was inaugurated %HESITATION all of those women that took to the streets of America where knows **** hats except they didn't call them **** hands they called on the plus side hands well Pamela Geller has found a video and done some still shots where she thinks the god of the shooter why is wearing one of those hats and an anti trump rally I've looked at it and I I do not know I like from what I see I couldn't confirm it but there are others we're trying to make the case and that the girlfriend was there very nearby and also in the shots and she was holding anti trump signs or what have you he was wearing a pink **** had if it's the same guy and so because of that they're people think see this guy and this guy was anti trump never trump and a radical leftist or whatever the sheriff has alluded to the fact that is the sure there may have been radicalized it just kind of a throwaway line let's go on a couple sound bites the sheriff is Joe Lombardo he had a press conference last night in Las Vegas during the queue in a reporters and can you tell the current whereabouts of Stephen paddocks girl friend that means Tom all I know is the Philippines Tom and we %HESITATION we are in conversation issued from early she's a person of so if you're a suspect not sugar currently a person of interest another reporter you talked about motive sheriff Lombardo you talked about premeditation you wanna learn why he did what he did can you tell us the number of interviews you'll have to do that how many abuses are gonna take before you get to a motive you talked about reviewing cameras videos computers who do you want to talk to you're probably saying more cheeses share secrets twenty seventeen how come it's taken so long for you to evaluate that because its evidentiary there's chain cussing issues associated with that sure worked he because you know he's out there right and there's this thing called the constitution we have to ensure that we're abiding by that can we ensure there I don't know if we have possible future prosecution you know you heard me say that we're comfortable that we have the suspect in custody for something more may come in that investigation and I want to understand the motivation that you describe okay to prevent any future in small we know that this person your radicalized unbeknownst to us you just throw that out there at the end your what what what well wait just a second what do you mean by that that this person get radicalized also arm you heard me say we're comfortable we have the suspect in custody the suspect is dead right so who is he talking about here or is that a slip of the tongue around my missing something is the norm we have the suspect in custody now I know he's speaking in generalities when he says well it's evidentiary and I'm not gonna tell you what evidence we got here because I don't know where this is going and waited obviously they don't have anything dead solid they wanna hang their hats on %HESITATION but we have been told I don't have every time it's come up we have been told no nope nope nope isis is wrong isis and I'm gonna do it if they have they have been thanks so what are the logical so that you know it's amazing this happens fifty nine dead over five hundred wounded with Ellen hours S. yes not militant Islamic terrorism go to Benghazi what we saw here was not militant Islamic terrorism it was I wrong it was a riot because of a video these people not talking to the sheriff these people don't have a lot of credibility of specially Hillary Clinton who has speaking in continued bro minds right out of the Democrat party playbook with nothing unique and that nothing and individual now although when I mentioned the politicization of this the format dashes on for gun control now what does that mean what does it actually mean what is the left really want I'll tell you what they want they want the confiscation of every known weapon in this country that's what they mean by gun control nothing less than that never mind that that's not possible that's what they mean they will never say it because I don't think they've got the guts to you know something strange about this yeah I'm I'm listen up all these people demanding we have no laws and no regulations yeah but no movement they get guns out of the people's hands and who are the people saying this in many cases these are people trying to tell us that Donald Trump cemex Hitler or the next but new doll more fully in a now if you'll if you happen to be one of these lunatics on the left demanding it everybody be forced to give up their guns and you also believe that Donald Trump is the next most believe me or Hitler you realize what a great contradiction you're making you think you're being led by the next totalitarian tyrant who is going to start putting political prisoners in jail and committing genocide against people who doesn't like at the same time you want to take away from yourselves and everybody else the primary way of defending against such a tyrant guns these people are lunatics if they really thought the truck was mostly here in NY or the oncoming Hitler they would want to arm up and be able to ward off any agency drops on to their house to **** him up and put in jail these people are cockeyed they're literally cockeyed yeah the Democrats they come along and they won't be honest about what they're actually demanding what they actually want they don't have the guts just like they don't have the guts to tell you the truth about any aspect of their agenda I have to camouflage that or mass get or just outright lie about it and they're trying to do and runs on this whole gun control thing what they want is for every gun that's in somebody's possession to be taken away from them and they want a massively powerful federal government run by a guy who they think is the next most only me to be the guy to take their end your guns away from you these people are not box on the logic train these people got off a long time ago they're not making any sense about anything except they are connecting emotionally Jimmy Kimmel is making no sense what so ever but it sounds sincere member what J. R. Ewing said once you figure out how to fake sincerity you can do anything once you know how to fake sincerity you don't need integrity you fool people all day and all night there's also another stab running out there that we need to deal with today it's been showing up in the New York times and the head coach of the New Orleans Saints Sean Payton fell for it I didn't know that Sean Payton apparently is a Republican is the coaching ranks and the New York times a couple days ago have us Hannah Alice that that because Sean pace that we got that our gun laws are not working religions are gun laws eyes honest that New York times art rages in the stat it as that more Americans have died due to domestic gunfire in the United States then an all American warriors combined now while the numbers may be close to being true it doesn't get anywhere near telling the true story and a column in The Washington Post written by somebody from Nate silver's website if this woman ever gets another bottle if you see miss if this woman ever gets under by wanna drive by media I'll be stunned I'll be stuck to this woman basically blown to smithereens the whole idea of the gun control would work back after this don't go away yeah here's a statistic got Nicholas Kristoff August twenty seventh two thousand fifteen %HESITATION or thereabouts Nicholas Kristoff in New York Times wrote that more Americans are killed by guns since nineteen sixty eight that in all U. S. wars not killed by guns means people were minding their own business somebody came up and shot up you know what the number one because of the death with guns in America is it is suicide bought a far and away the number one cause of death my god this is not a homicide it is suicide men killing themselves and they are they can flake this as a murderer when they start running these numbers talking about the number people who died via guns it's not the murder rate in the United States does not get anywhere near equaling the number of Americans killed in U. S. wars and this is what every gotta get up every day and listen to the lies in the half truths and and spent a lot of time defending this that often and blowing the lies to smithereens correcting it with the truth so I got to do it again here today on this hi how are you welcome back no rush well having more fun than a human being should be allowed to have let me break this down %HESITATION just a brief sense here will get into a little bit more detail in a second but the the the way to express this this that more Americans killed by guns since nineteen sixty eight that all U. S. wars The New York Times been running this I say in and Sean Payton sought he said I saw this the NBC sports talk website yesterday SO is Tuesday when Peyton now Monday when Peyton would've seen it and he says that he's a Republican so this is how it works out what we've got to change our laws in doubt as to what we're doing now isn't working so that everybody harp on it because he's a Republican he's an NFL coach Womack know that it's really you really must be better Republicans are losing support of it and in the New York times is considered a Bible and infallible by way too many people arm people don't understand the New York times is nothing more than your average leftist organization which is pushing an agenda and does not do a nose anymore there isn't any new is immediate or very little knows defined as a reporter somewhere where you aren't and recording what happened there and then telling you that's what losers that's not what's happening knows is how can we get trump is essentially what the news has today how can we expose trump badly damaged trump card we ruin drum tackle we separate trump on his orders that is the agenda in the American drive by media today so you have a statistic like this that and the New York times is leaving the maybe a charge on trying to get rid of the second amendment which is the objective that they all have and everything they report about his aim to further that policy or that hope but the vast majority of gun deaths in America are by way of suicide not murder if you want to compare the number of people who die in war compared to the number people who are shot with guns in America the number is one fourth twenty five percent up one quarter of deaths by gardens are from homicide the rest are suicides or accidental deaths and all of the homicides it usually male on male and a majority of it is gang related the murder rate cops versus citizens is so tiny it barely shows up and yet look at what we're doing a statistic that is so insignificant barely shows up is now causing all kinds a halo and havoc in the National Football League and now in the effort of the left to literally confiscate guns because that's what they want they publish misleading statistics and when you hear that more people have died by gunfire in America since nineteen sixty eight them all loss of life in wars since the beginning of a country that well but it's not true so size not homicide but they want you to believe that every gun death is the result of somebody killing somebody and technically it is but the vast majority of deaths with guns in America are suicide they are not homicide but the New York times has got this lie halfway around the world before this program starts every day so we constantly play catch up now I mentioned day an op ed in The Washington Post that ran yesterday it's by a woman named Leah live Brzesko and she is a statistician a former news writer at five thirty eight at David journalism site that is the website of Nate silver who is a polling and big data analyst god to people on the left and this woman Leila Brzesko used to be a statistician there helping to crunch the numbers of big data to prepare that data for inclusion in articles that were written and posted on the five thirty eight dot com website she admits that she used to believe after every incident such as Las Vegas or sandy hook or what happened out in Arizona with Gabby Giffords she used to be one of the is who just instinctively reflexively started shouting gun control gun control gun control we need more gun control sol she and her like minded statisticians and friends at five thirty eight undertook an in depth research project to prove to themselves that what they were demanding what could happen and would make a difference and here's the headline accompanying her story after such research quote I use to think gun control with the was the answer my research told me otherwise have you by the way I heard about this won't Brian you heard about this %HESITATION study seen as a dog you see nothing cable news Mister snuggly you said you saw the story but if you seen it discussed on TV anyway not and the story's been suppressed I mean it was published but it obviously hasn't gone much farther than the Washington post because it just destroys everything the leftists trying to get done it destroys the reasoning the logic the fact destroys everything by way of leftist research here's how she opens her piece before I started researching gun deaths gun control policy used to frustrate me I wished the a and R. A. would stop blocking common sense gun control reforms like banning assault weapons or restricting silencers we're shrinking magazine sizes all the other measures that could make guns less deadly make comes less deadly a gun is not deadly it's who's holding it that makes it deadly but you're never going to convince a leftist to look at it that way but a gun is an inanimate object which cannot pick itself up a gun doesn't hate anybody a gun doesn't have any prejudice a gun doesn't have any bigotry and a gun cannot fire itself and it doesn't care who it's aimed at it doesn't even know much like a fish doesn't even know it's in the water and then she writes my colleagues and I at five thirty eight spent three months analyzing all of thirty three thousand lives ended by guns every year in America and I wound up frustrated in a whole new way we looked at what interventions might have saved those people and the case from the policies of Eide lobbied for crumbled when I examined the evidence in other words the policy she had lobbied for banning assault weapons restricting silencer shrinking magazine sizes all of those things crumbled when she examined the evidence behind the thirty three thousand deaths the best ideas left standing were narrowly tailored interventions to protect some types of potential victims not broad attempts to limit the lethality of guns this is a profound from home it's coming folks there's a profound she bought it unlike every leftist does that you can make a dime less deadly that you can ban assault weapons he's left us don't even know what they're talking about which you get to really shouldn't they don't even know what they're talking about which are talking about assault weapons they don't know what they're talking about when they start talking about semi automatic they know what they're talking about when they start restricting silencers because it watch too much TV a silencer is not what you see on a TV show a silencer does not go it's much louder it's not even a silencer it's called a suppressor is to protect the ears of the shooter or shrinking magazines I see all of these alterations to the gardens she was part of the pack believe doing those would make the guns less lethal when she found out that's pointless hopeless an irrelevant the only way she says that these deaths might be prevented is biting narrowly tailoring interventions like finding out who's going to kill themselves and stopping them after shooting in Las Vegas my fifty eight people dead fifty nine an injured over five hundred senator Chris Murphy Democrat Connecticut said Congress's failure to pass gun control legislation amounts to an on intentional endorsement of mass shootings well she says I I researched strictly tighten the gun laws in Britain and Australia I concluded they didn't prove much about what America's policy should be a tale why she went and looked around the one where they have the strictest gun laws in the world and found they didn't make any difference just as they don't make any difference in Chicago which is only common sense laws do not stop behavior laws defiant improper proper criminal behavior analysts and and prescribed punishment law is how society in effect charts its virtue and morality and in some cases log does provide disincentive but but not universally we still have laws against murder and people still do it and she said I figured this out going around the world looking at places was strong gun laws and finding out that it didn't matter when I looked at other often praised policies get this paragraph folks listen this is the this is the liberal elite well I I'm assuming she is she writes five thirty eight dot com at David journalism site Leah labrusca listen to this when I looked and the other often praise policies I found out that no gun owner walks into the store to buy an assault weapon and she was shocked she was stunned you know why well she'll like everybody else pays attention to the drive by media and assault weapons semi automatic is how every gun is referenced and so she was part of the crowd that was led to believe that gun owners are among the most serious reprobation our society and they want Oslo weapons they're not countries you've heard him say that they're not hundreds he's a guy they want assault weapons semi automatic she found out no gun owner walks into the store to buy an assault weapon and then she writes this that is an invented classification that includes any semi automatic that has two or more features which could include a bayonet mount a rocket propelled grenade launcher mount a folding stock or a pistol grip she found out that those are the qualifications for assault weapon not massively big magazine not semi automatic or automatic firing she was shocked when she learned that everything she thought she'd knew wasn't true and she was gone when she found out that people are going to gun stores to buy guns are not walking and looking for quote unquote assault weapons it's amazing she wrote this it's amazing a Washington post published this and is it ever an I opener because it exposes how the left using the media to move their agenda forward has succeeded she says guns are modular any hobbyist you can easily add any of these features of home as if they were snapping together legos Anne hobbyists can attach a bayonet mount a rocket propelled grenade launcher folding stock or a pistol grip and she was she was surprised to learn that's what an assault weapon is and nobody walks in to buy one then she talks about silencers and how that's not what they are they're suppressors Hollywood is creating correctness and Nyssa information not silencers they don't go and nobody can hear when you fire she said the suppressor on a are fifteen which is the hated weapon of the day they favored weapon of the moment a suppressor I quote unquote silencer on a are fifteen is as loud as a Jack hammer and there's still some to go in this but you you get the drift here she did you know that to look in after all these deaths to find out how to make guns less lethal and she found everything she found contradicted everything she'd been led to believe continue and we're back Rush Limbaugh serving humanity simply by showing up one more paragraph here from Leah Brzesko The Washington Post as my coworkers and I kept looking at the data if seemed less and less clear that a single big gun control legislation or restriction could make a difference you realize how profound this is for somebody like this to be admitting this about Paul published in The Washington Post think of looking at the data less and less it seemed that broad stroke gun control restrictions would make a difference two thirds here's the stat fox two thirds of gun deaths in the United States every year are suicides they're not mass shootings they're not murders %HESITATION thirds are suicides and there's not a single proposed restriction on guns that would change that not a single one she said I I couldn't even answer my own desperate question if I had a friend who had guns in his home and a history of suicide attempt was there anything I can do that would help there's not a single piece of legislation there's not a new regulation there's not enough there's nothing Washington could do to change this she's aptly right here is an in Rochester New York great to have you a personally how are you there are some really good how are you fine thanks much I'm I've been listening to since nineteen eighty eight lighter in the beginning I read your life's appeared part of my family thank you very much ma'am I appreciate that it it's amazing %HESITATION I remember I could even tell you but back when your ears are having problems but but but but but Russia rulers and people like you are a friend of mine what's up with rush and they are just really really appreciate your input over the years well thanks it might look I I I I I understand what you're your point there I feel the same way and reverse it's familial here it really is a bond here I get it totally it really is my daughter came into the basement I work at home in my basement I do re upholstery and furniture restoration and she said well I've been hearing that guy first for many years to my whole life is like is it just he is not of a rush St at all none of my children are but %HESITATION well that means you've not done a good job yet you you need to have done better than that knife none of Orange County I'm tryin Bulkley why do you listen to much is because I want to know all the different points of view I listen to everybody else to I mean I I I I wanna good grounded the one thing I have really grown into my children don't listen to somebody else view about someone else you listen to them not what someone outlines I can't argue with that can argue with that no you can't only wait listening just now on the fact that there's no answers is my point there's no answers for so many of the issues that the left champions arm there's no answer for the fact that people are going to die letting everyone there people are going to die if we lose obamacare course people gonna die anyway there that there's an even one climates and sonic thing when you you know what I'm saying and this is a brilliant point as I've said it my own way but you're saying it differently here that all of these issues the left goes for none of them can be fixed there isn't any solution any of them which I have to I have to expand on that a lot of time here but I have to expand alright the first hour is in the can't what an hour it wise and there's still a couple big revelations ago office Washington post please brilliant yes and a reaction to our phone call there from on Graham and so hang on fox because we're coming back order then you will build the hi welcome back folks it's a delight to be with you great privilege I have a chance to be with you here every day behind the golden EIB microphone Rush Limbaugh eight hundred two eight two two eight eight two again we're gonna go forth our today the program will continue after the broadcast conclusion take a couple of minutes it's just at the top of the hour but at three o'clock eastern we we resume for web site subscribers on late rush twenty four seven subscribers Rush Limbaugh dot com just just blindly the way you always do it the random on air button up there if you're if you click on that you know and you remember you will have access to what what we call the fourth hour are in addition to the phone number email L. rush poet EIB net dot U. S. you know the point that our previous caller made I've made it in my own way a number of different times but the way she said this the left always has these their issue was are things that can never really get fixed things that really don't have a governmental solution she mentioned healthcare but she included climate change and if you stop and think about it she is exactly right now in the case of climate change they claim we can fix it but but we won't know long after all people today alive today are dead or most of us they never they never forecast the calamity is to occur within our lifetimes the sea level rise see this is this is one of the great contradictions too by the way the sea level rise the ice caps melting all of these horrible things are thirty years down the road in some cases fifty years down the road and that's done purposefully sense so many will not be around to know whether they were right and wrong but then while they tell us that all of this coming catastrophe dom then a hurricane hits city see see what what what what what what what what about you you say it's thirty forty fifty years from now you know put the hurricane see see see what hurricanes are no different today than they've ever been it's over there fewer of them %HESITATION but you're worse than what no no no no not gun control is another classic and this piece from The Washington Post we're going to highlight the link to this preset Rush Limbaugh dot com as listeners now again this author use to work a former news writer at five thirty eight dot com the Nate silver website that crunches big data numbers and forecasts election outcomes for Democrats until it looks like they're going to lose and then against Democrats but it's a it's a it's a drive my media site and that's highly respected and very very eagerly anticipated that each statistical posted this writer Alija Brzesko was somebody who believe that guns could be made less dangerous guns could be made less deadly with the proper federal legislation and regulations she believed that you can turn a gone into not being an assault rifle and make it less dangerous then she found out what actually makes a Ghanem's alright for slot weapon and it's and on things like a bayonet mount a rocket propelled grenade launcher mount folding stock or pistol grip she found out that people are going to gun stores to buy guns do not say show me the assault weapons she found out that assault weapons semi automatic weapon our media constructs to convey dark deep danger when it's not people don't buy guns that way gun owners don't think of salt every every guns assault weapon depends on what you're gonna do with it then depends on who's got possession of it begun by itself is an inanimate object but the left believes that there is no magic legislation that can make comes less dangerous that we can perfect goes actually don't think that what they want is every gun confiscated not many of them will not have the guts to say that because it's they don't want to expose them so they know there's no way that's gonna happen but that's what they really want so they try to get closer and closer and closer to it but they will be honest with you about that just like they won't be honest about any of their agenda so this woman starts researching she and her team found out that everything they thought they believe was wrong found out that two thirds of all gun deaths in the United States are suicides and there's not a single federal restriction that would change it how do you outlaw suicide what federal regulation you pass that will stop suicide and she is rightly concluded there isn't one so she said the solution here is not dealing with the guns but finding a way to get to people who are suicidal and giving them counseling or therapy to talk them out of it nothing to do with the guns and it was a sad sad discovery is everything she believed much of what you believe blow up no proposed restriction would as she she traveled around the world and found all the strict gun laws and found out they weren't making any difference you have to go to Australia you okay gone to Chicago could have gone to Washington by the time we published our project she says I didn't believe in many of the interventions I have heard politicians tout I was still anti gun at least from the point of view most gun owners and I don't want a gun in my home is I think the risk outweighs the benefits but I cannot endorse policies whose only selling point is that gun owners hates them policies and often to see him as if they were drafted by people who have encountered guns only as a figure in a briefing book or an image on the news of the words she says that most of the left that is touting gun control legislation comes up with things that the and are a is going to stand up and oppose right off the bat if you found out she can't endorse things whose only selling point is that gun owners hate them it's not going to accomplish anything but in noticing this what did she reveal she revealed that one of the tactics here is to be provocative and because the N. R. A. and the gun lobby and gun owners to stand up and righteous indignation and make of them selves bigger targets while the attack on the Los Vegas strip is the deadliest in modern American history attacks in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries have higher death tolls did you know that she concludes by saying ET we save lives by focusing on a range of tactics to protect the different kinds of potential victims and reforming potential killers not from sweeping bands focused on the guns themselves let me read this to you again because it's interesting from where it comes from whom it comes we can save lives by focusing on a range of tactics to protect the different kinds of victims and reforming potential killers not from the suite me sweeping bans focused on the guns themselves in other words she in our own way is admitting that the gun is nothing I'm jealous of the hands of an evil doer or someone who is suicidal OP one to switch gears here you'll printer Ricoh has been on the on the back burner even though the president has been there the drive by media who have been reporting on this are nevertheless reporting it trumps box did that trump doesn't care because most of the people down there are not white they're actually people in the drive by media say was my name on CNN that trump doesn't care or not white if I wouldn't vote for he doesn't really care despite the fact that he's been down there despite the fact even helping to pass out AA than putting together relief packages and so forth so all the server at treasury secretary today Mick Mulvaney not that I'm sorry is the office of management %HESITATION and and budget is the Olympic I've and he is very rush maybe but what we have interviewed him for the Limbaugh letter I met him when I was at the White House back in March sharp sharp guy %HESITATION invade trumps management of our office manager budget guy he was on with the freight %HESITATION Cuomo today on the C. N. N. and Frito sand and and Mick Mulvaney has been talking about trust and talk about all the fate lose about trump and is not caring and all the other be yes the media has been reporting out of up Porto Rico and Frodo said what's what's fake about our reporting about the depth of despair in the need for we've what's what's fake about that all y'all show is the bad stuff we spent several hours on the island yesterday afternoon got a chance for example get briefed by the US army corps of engineers the folks working on the electrical grid and by the way some of the efforts down there are absolutely fantastic we met with the mayors of Los small town there's a lot of good things happening at the the president's frustration our frustration as an administration is that the media seems to only want to focus on the bad things and not show both sides of the story I think that's a fair frustration to half not Fredo really this kind of a complaints do not register with fright it's it's it's hard to describe the single mindedness of most in the media it's hard to describe the lack of curiosity they have for anything other than what they think or what they believe but I'm telling you they don't have any curiosity there isn't a validity to anything they don't already believe or think right now and so when Mulvaney comes along as you guys only telling half the story you you you guys are are engaging in fake news here and Freida thanks the only story in Puerto Rico is despair Fredo thanks the only story is the human depravity late human despair to human poverty the only story is the destruction the only story is how nothing is getting fixed the only story is that nobody seems to care about it as far as they're concerned there isn't anything else from their minds of their war they'd be reporting it and so so many come to what you guys are not telling the whole story fritos genuinely shocked he doesn't think there is anything else Fred always you'll not find them in the leadership of this where they define the leftist agenda he's a he's a foot soldier are a loyal foot soldier who wants to impress management in the leaders so whatever he picks up on that they care about that's all there is there isn't another side there isn't an alternative and they're not making anything up so given that I want you to understand that as you listen to their conversation continue what two sides to the story they need is a real ultimate business address is it would mean we killed at sea with what two sides of the story I love this did I not just say I didn't I I knew what was coming next but I had not read the transcript outside this is an example of how I know these people better than I know themselves he doesn't think there's another side to the story beside their reporting is it and only it and anybody who thinks otherwise is biased anybody who thinks there's another side to this is prejudiced or a conservative or whatever he genuinely doesn't think and doesn't know there's another side to this just like there wasn't and Katrina just like there's another side to the story of trump colluding in Russia it happened they just can't find the other jet but it happened sparse freight does concern so he says you're what two sides of the story the need Israel the distress Israel that's the only thing that matters in part to recall people are hurting people are suffering there in distress income doesn't care and drug isn't running about at as far as he's concerned that's yet there is nothing else but that didn't the jet the airline it's still missing there isn't any other side so here it is again now that you know here's the whole exchange what two sides to the story they need Israel the distress Israel we are showing the efforts because of the rhetoric out of his White House we spent a lot of our time talking to first responders who are saying why do you say we're not working why do you say that we're not down here to help nobody has reported that make it it's dangerous to do that not only is it a distraction I still not later lately but when there's a credible not believed in me but I want to make sure the context is right they need Israel that's not just the bad stuff it's the reality yellow put up a status that only seven percent of the island has electricity that's absolutely accurate but what you don't report is how it's being done why it's being prioritized the focus is on getting power to hospitals to water filtration is and pump houses nursing homes old age retirement homes first that story simply doesn't get reported at all I think that's at the root of frustration it's an excellent point she to Frodo only seven percent of the island has power that's horrible that I got these disparities people suffering and you can't tell us not to report it because that's real that's all that's really the only thing that matters to the news if suffering that's all we do we find suffering everywhere that we can blame on Republicans we find despair everywhere we can blame on Republicans and dropping that's real that we reported in Israel if you can't like he's maniacal about this and Mulvaney says you're not telling how that seven percent happen you're looking at seven percent is a negative and we're looking at it as recovery and a positive and here's why we're doing it where we're doing it first I guarantee you Freida was clueless hearing as because nobody prior to Mulvaney have even explain this to him and I dare say had they tried he would have thought they were trying to manipulate him and get him to not covered the despair and that's what they really think when there's despair and when they're suffering and you can blame that on the Republicans don't try to disguise it don't try to confuse us don't try to manipulate us in the not reporting which is good just pay is real and it's trumps fault that you Republicans won't always ears and so we're going to focus on it and you can't trick us and you can't fool us more babies those when they're not denying the despair freddo it's that there are people here working around the clock to bring it all back and you're making it sound like nothing's happening and I guarantee you that doesn't compete with Frodo because the stock on the disparity Missouri in the suffering of trump's bald and that's what they gotta keep drilling homey so so there's one more exchange but I'll get to it after this yeah get smack dab the phone calls a minute but you got to hear the next and the last sound bite Mick Mulvaney OMB and frayed alcohol right now doesn't like it here when mold maybe enrages him by telling afraid though that he sure that CNN will do a better job going forward when there are people coming up to you on the streets begging for help you don't say well you know things aren't as bad as you think my friend could've been Katrina magic how that they had that so when you do in a situation like this you report the reality and it's not being done to you make to the president to embarrass you which just being able to reinforce the need whatever's being done it's not enough make well the good news is that you're you're clearly gonna do a better job going for we appreciate that we couldn't do any better job than we've done so far CNN has been down there like an army of ants from the beginning trying to show the need they're starting from practically nothing you do not bring electricity back to an island of three and a half million people in two weeks when you're starting from practically nothing so you do sit there obsessed they're obsessed with it yeah is so forgive oracle is not being bad bad any do mean it's your fault make in it is your fault trump they wouldn't that never report this kind of suffering in need when Obama was in the White House log they would only focus on how great the effort was to alleviate it which is mulberries point okay rate in Savannah Georgia great to have you Sir your next as we head back to the phones great with heavy with issue all you have to write a good afternoon high that's the first time I've ever called a radio show in my life but instead of yelling at the radio I figure I would call the the left that constant claiming the weapon that the gun for creating all the problems that we have all the death and destruction but Hollywood get absolutely no plain for all of the death and destruction of the glamorizing they do using %HESITATION firearms weapons guns dies murder and mayhem again absolutely zero %HESITATION blame for any of that the destruction to go you know and you can you can accuse Hollywood of promoting smoking to there's not a movie or TV show around it some characters not constantly lighting up and it's made to look cool that's just like the violence is yes Sir and and I think that doubt %HESITATION I you know I don't listen to radio it made it much I should but I I I wish that does some of the Serbian both with a start bring up the point every time they they want to blame the gun for violence I think that doubt they are saying we are Cecconi's but making all these murderous movies alright I can write great let me say I'm glad you college grants great that you did I'm adds it's fabulous to hear from you but you you say you don't caller listen much you need to know that this is a point that is routinely brought up by people and when it is Hollywood constantly rejects it I mean the first notable instance of theirs al gore's wife and James Baker's wife I think it was back in the nineties actually testified before Congress about all of this and Hollywood's it that doesn't influence people dozens of entertainment people know that and then something else will happen where they will claim credit for the good behavior that people see in movies trying to emulate so it's great to have you here hang around right Hey up let me ask you a question couple questions has has your pencil when you've been writing or your pen ever misspelled a word no I'm just asking %HESITATION has your car ever driven drunk well depending on the way SUV accidents are covered for awhile there when they were trying to demonizing the media didn't treat SUV's is all they have minds of their own SUVs for driving off parking garage Ruth's SUV is work killing their drivers because SUVs were evil to climate change %HESITATION did you fork make you fat you're answering not all this right if were you trying to argue energy thinking about what I want your fork is made you fat or not not your for that a fork just jump out of a drawer in your kitchen and embed itself in that job I scream and then find your mouth while you or innocently starving yourself watching TV didn't happen that it the pencil didn't misspell a word the fork didn't make you fat and your car never get a fire hydrant drunk **** Tiger Woods but yet guns are killing people well I'm just I'm just sharing with you the kind of logic you get in the town of real where I your host am the mayor are back to the phones Julian Temecula California great to have you how are you I ride I'm great I'm so happy to talk with you Houston listeners and saw the Clinton withholding of hostage on TV okay sent us a letter while that %HESITATION anyway I am I apologize because I only heard just one so I can't tell you were a harder %HESITATION that went green from Texas began the impeachment process yes Al Green Al Green yeah that the Democrats were furious because the impeachment proceedings Priscilla guy hurt there are no where impeachment proceedings needed to be on Mahler's timing he wasn't ready so you gonna come up with his Big Bang whatever whenever that's going to happen and going with under a lot of pressure from the Democrats to walk back the impeachment process that he initiated and wish you know what they get would you use it was yeah restrict proposed but so called postponing it making the Democrats were carrying and they're going to do it but they were mad at him that's why we didn't hear from Maxine waters I'm sure she kept her mouth shut and they were all mad at him free market back perfect timing this horrible tragedy that we women seem we mention this yes it al Greenlee is up you know he's in the same way have you heard there's there's a congressman from Georgia his name is Hank something or other is it Hank Johnson yeah I this guy and you heard of this guy a joint that this guy was afraid of any action taken on Guam that would relocate people because he thought you put too many people on one side of the island it would capsize.
