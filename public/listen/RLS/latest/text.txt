president drug drug yet another slice out of obamacare last night an even bigger slice than what he took out of it yesterday all before the program began in what he actually did was enforce the rule of law there was an aspect of obamacare that has been on constitutional from the get go and drama ended it a rule of law triumphs and survives great to have you on the program today fog online Friday where polar zero two jul is what it is they talk about doesn't have to be related to anything that we have talked about or that I care about can be anything that's what's different about it usually ends up sounding the same because I talk about so much it's impossible for people to come up with things I haven't thought about anyway once great to have your telephone number eight hundred two eight two two eight eight two of the email address L. rush lower the IBM that dot you asks these were the obamacare subsidies to insurance companies that would never authorized by the United States Congress the president of the United States cannot **** nilly start spending money unless it's authorized by the house of representatives and the subsidies to the insurance companies never have been subsidies to obamacare patients had never been authorized by Congress are the Republicans didn't have any fingerprints on the original obamacare it was a Democrat passed bill that was not a single Republican vote on it and as such whatever obamacare wise it's totally wrong to blame the Republicans for any of it because at the time they didn't have the votes to stop it and at the time the Democrats didn't permit them to participate anyway it's not a complicated explanation of what happened but it's quite controversial because this was a big deal for the Democrats and now they're out squealing like stuck pigs over what this is going to mean to people and it isn't going to have a dramatic negative impact immediately I'm people once again it simply is reinforcing the constitution of the United States a major aspect of obamacare that made it possible was on constitutional and it you might or why didn't drug do this at first because he's been trying to have an obamacare repeal she's been working through channels if you might say he's been trying to use the house and the Senate have them play along and come up with a unified effort to repeal obamacare and then come up with something else but the house and the Senate Democrats especially but the Republicans really more than anybody didn't want to play ball and senator McCain every chance he got the sabotage whatever effort might of happened he took that opportunity and so they Congress never did the act like adults and get something done so after nine months of patience I'm trying to do it the way the swamp does things the president decided enough is it not it would you have to know have the Democrats they've been running around talking about how obamacare is hopelessly broken obamacare is this an obamacare is that well maybe so I don't doubt it but the Republicans have nothing to do with it and trump especially had nothing to do with it trump doesn't have a single thing to do with the current status of Bob obamacare or its origins but if the Democrats are running around saying it's a mess but they're not gonna help fix it why even talk to them because of the fact of the matter is the Democrats single handedly designed and built what amounts to a halfway house for socialized medicine and now it's on fire it's burning down as per the design to deny that is to lie the Democrats built whatever obamacare is trump is trying to get Congress to get off their collective rear ends and deal with this to blame crop for the obamacare mass or its flaws in failures is draw dropping only stupid the one person in Washington that literally has had nothing to do with the current status of obamacare is Donald Trump obamacare started out unaffordable and it's become even more unaffordable and you know this when they put the name off for double in the title of the bill obamacare has been propped up with illegal subsidies that is not sustainable in fact it's unsustainable free markets are self correcting heavily regulated markets are self defeating and obamacare was a massively regulated market and it was regulated by people who don't like free markets it was created and regulated by people who really don't understand them so it's it's kinda like what the NFL trump is accelerating the inevitable it's better to deal with it now than the let it become yet another wine Stian size problem which is where it's headed now here's what happened yesterday right before the program began the president had a press conference little ceremony at the White House where if you took a what you call a knife to a certain %HESITATION aspect of obamacare and %HESITATION rendered it basically impotent and corrected it OB that that that you have to remember that that the payments that we're talking about that what he did last night the cutting of subsidies payments to insurers are illegal a federal judges ruled that they're unconstitutional because they were never authorized by Congress and that's what trump did last night in the double whammy the attack on federal subsidies this is from a from a %HESITATION website that doesn't like what trump did so they call it the attack on federal subsidies came as a double blow to obamacare just hours after trump had already lashed out at his predecessors healthcare reforms by issuing an executive order unilaterally weakening the system yeah I'm the executive order that happened about twenty four hours ago the president opened the door to cheaper and less comprehensive insurance it allows people to form their own associations and allows you to buy health insurance policies that only feature things you want it doesn't mandate that young healthy people pay the most expensive premiums which is what obamacare did remember the whole theory behind obamacare at least the theory on the surface anybody could say young and healthy people would be required I if we have a mandate to purchase massive health insurance policies that they wouldn't every you is because they're healthy therefore the cost to take care of them would be nil but they would pay the freight for elderly and poor people who could not afford to pay these premiums and that is how they would be treated that's how they would be covered well young people just I can't afford it they didn't buy it they painted the pines instead and the numbers of uninsured continue to skyrocket so what sounded magnanimous and what sounded familiar in what sounded system in a bowl wasn't working at all young people don't wanna buy things that deal with their death they're not thinking about death at that stage of their lives they don't want to have to go out and buy insurance policies that feature things they will never ever needed like a young man being forced to buy contraceptive coverage what the hell it made no sense but these rather things when you mix left wing politics with the mandate of socialism these are the things that resulted in people just stayed away and didn't want us obamacare never had enough money it never had the ability to even get anywhere near succeeding which I still think is part of the design or trump came in yesterday and wiped all that out and basically said insurance companies are now free to create packages and programs that actually respond to customers needs small businesses and others are free to form their own associations create their own groups if you will and go out and via competition in the insurance market fine policies that feature things they actually want to have insurance more at premiums that'll make sense because of the competitive element that has been the re introduced into the whole mass that the obamacare design removed so the president opened the door to cheaper and less comprehensive insurance and that is considered very very bad by the drug buys cheaper and less comprehensive other words people are not going to have the same coverage that means there won't be equality and that means it probably isn't sustainable to them and of course the experts at don't understand markets are out there predicting wildly of that trumps executive order yesterday close to no end result in health plans for the sick becoming more expensive than they already were expensive and getting more expensive and more on available that's the whole point and everybody was complaining about it but the Democrats are the only people with fingerprints on it so this is what pushing back looks like and this is what fixing something looks like last night could be an actual old death blow to the whole concept of obamacare because it targeted the very foundations all the insurance structures created by obamacare there was a study by the Congressional Budget Office a couple months ago that suggested terminating the cost sharing subsidies would lead to a dramatic twenty percent rise in the average cost of the most popular plans offered by obamacare as well as worsening the federal deficit you'll love this here we are in the middle of a disaster a failing disaster that is blowing the budget deficit sky high and rapidly adding to the national debt people are becoming less and less in short there is less coverage in the market it's falling apart the Democrats lead the charge trump goes in to fix something in the drive by media says that all of this is going to worsen the federal deficit and so I think a rational budget office it's the exact opposite you can't do both things you can't run around and complain about what a mess it is and it was only comes along and fixes it complained about the mess that it's supposedly going to create the mess already exists what's happening is an attempt to fix this by getting rid of it well just the left in the drive bys they have an emotional attachment to obamacare and I just don't want to let it go basically what happened was trump administration announced it wasn't immediately ending cost sharing reduction payments to health insurance companies who are offering plans on the obamacare exchanges and regardless of what anybody says there is nothing about this that if sabotage all that is happened here is that the rule of law has been I abided by these subsidies subsidies to the insurance companies back door pay backs pay offs to the insurance companies have never been legal they are unconstitutional and the reason is simple the president of the United States cannot walk into the treasury and ask for an amount of money and give it to whoever he wants the constitution says that all appropriations all spending must originate in the house the representatives there are people who have read the entire text of obamacare and they will happily tell you that no where it may obamacare text is there an inclusion for an appropriation for these subsidies these subsidies what they do is reimburse insurance carriers for discounting deductibles and co pays for low income people in the exchanges it's a sop it's Obama and the Democrats knowing that they devise something that was unaffordable so to get the insurance companies to play ball and not oppose this obamacare offered to subsidize them if they would lower the price below market levels for people that are poor or sick or what have you the insurance companies one along with it because they were being paid back by the gun they were guaranteed not to lose money on this and yet they still end up losing money the Obama administration knew that this was unconstitutional but they went ahead and made the payments anyway because they know that nobody on the right wing was going to have the guts to stand up and stop it so they just did whatever they wanted to do because the Republicans did not know what pushed back means they didn't even know what opposition means other than speaking it but actually engaging and it never happened you can't blame Obama who you know what those guys don't have a good stop me I don't know why first African American president all be called restore you know what we're just gonna walk over treasury not grab a new given sure it's going to go look me and I'll go get this done and how they did it totally anti and make and and %HESITATION unconstitutional nobody said a word because course who were the beneficiaries the poor the downtrodden okay sick but that's not who benefitted who benefitted was the insurance companies the federal government was subsidizing making sure the insurance companies earned a profit or at the worst did not lose any money but again the constitution expressly prohibits when it stopped obamacare subsidies being erased by trump last night is not a political move it's a legal move and what happened was the rule of law why is respect didn't and it triumphed and something that should never have happened was fixed and we'll be right back don't go away now another way to look at this is and this was crony capitalism actually at crony socialism this was Obama co loading with the big insurance companies to protect them and prevent them from having to deal with competition and rewarding them by subsidizing what ever costs they encountered in implementing the law of obamacare all of that that collusion was unconstitutional Obama did not have the constitutional right even if he had written an executive order that is unconstitutional now the Republicans in my house didn't sue Obama over these pavements case still winding its way through the courts is probably moot by now but the end result is that the insurance companies now have to go back into these markets and compete something they have not had to do it since two thousand ten they now have to compete for business and they now have to devise products that if people can afford because there are no more subsidies they have to come up with policies that people can afford and that people will want to buy and with competition entering the market the likelihood of one or both of those things happening rather rapidly is pretty good not in there that politics isn't everything and there's corruption and everything in these insurance companies I'm sure grow to love Obama and the Democrat party and I'm sure they are populated by a bunch a leftist and hate trump and so they might do their best to hold out and thwart what trump is trying to do here like leftist judges they will be in violation of the law if they do but what's new about that the people on the left it would require further pursue it if these kinds of things happen to some Republicans are worried well you know why you guys do this trump your dough this Republic who you're gonna end up owning whatever the result is it was bad enough as it was but that was obamacare now it's not gonna be obamacare it's going to be whatever the press calls it trump care trump disaster what have you fine there are risks in fixing things there are risks in taking on giant projects in trying to improve them it was never a reason not to do it typical swamp no we can't fix this because if it doesn't work we'll on it we can't have a bad name and some people just have to continue to get screwed rather than us take a hit now look I'm sitting here anticipating some things that you might be curious about may be worried about when you hear that subsidies are ending you might think what it says the insurance companies for the subs is there any what what does it mean for me so let me spell this out not in the first place about the GOP lawsuit trump has said that the GOP did so they sued the government on the basis that these obamacare subsidies the insurance companies were unconstitutional and trump has said he's not going to defend against the suit I mean it's a moot point now anyway because this accomplishes what the lawsuits thought now we're not talking about massive amounts of money here I have a peace sign up by a guy named Christopher Jacobs and his own website for the time being individuals likely will not see any direct effect from these subsidies ending carriers cannot accept the obamacare exchanges mid year contract for the two thousand eighteen planner already signed a provision in carriers two thousand seventeen in two thousand eighteen contracts let them exit the exchanges if in the wrong ways do not receive cost sharing reductions not if the insurers themselves don't restatement and this is an important point a provision in the carriers the insurers two thousand seventeen two thousand eighteen contract essentially what obamacare let them exit the exchanges if enrollees do not receive cost sharing reductions not if the insurers themselves do not so the fact that the subsidies are ending does not automatically permit the carriers from leaving the exchanges if this sounds weird is because it is the clause was awkwardly drafted by lawyers for the insurer and it may provide them a little legal recourse in it further highlights questionable assumptions in behavior surrounding these subsidies so as Mister Jacobs right here maybe Washington can spend some time focusing on the real issue behind the administration's action and that's upholding the constitution whether it this is a thing to I I don't know if the primary mover in trump ending the subsidies what is upholding the constitution or whether it was policy related I hope it's a little bit of both but I certainly hope they did what they did in part because they realize what was happening was unconstitutional and therefore anything that comes along to try to address this cannot likewise Brady are unconstitutional but the bottom line is we're not talking about massive amounts of money here this year the insurers are on track to re seems seven billion dollars in the subsidies or reimbursements and ten billion dollars next year and that I must say that's according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office all those numbers could be wrong they can be totally made up or they can be obviously wrong or whatever but here's the thing as far as consumers are concerned trump is not ending the tax credits tax credits are the real and bigger subsidy that the poor get we are simply talking about subsidies the government was paying the insurance companies those are what have been and get and they were unconstitutional in the first place but this does not and tax credits people go to the exchange sign up if they can't afford it if they qualify on the basis of poverty or hardship that may get subsidies or tax credits those survive for now and you you can get tax credits of your at four hundred percent of the poverty level which eight bit and that has not been changed some people are saying that ending the insurance provided subsidies ending the obamacare payments to the insurance companies some are saying this just gonna mean these poor people will get the same amount or more back in tax credits bottom line trump has said that he stop this because it was illegal and that's what he is saying is his motive and that's good now also coming up on the program today a couple of gigantic see I told you sos about liberalism abortion and Hollywood and I had what I thought was a very clever bit yesterday frankly I expected this to pop up all over the media and there's not a blip up it which means they're really occupied with other things if I can maybe three gigantic see I told you sos today I told you I have the I. involved a theory United actually evolve this theory while speaking to you it hit me while I was in the moment of monologue about why all these men in Hollywood claim to be sold pro choice and claim to be so interested in women's rights and it's nothing other than getting laid and the evidence is a bond that now I have always won how in the world can all of these guys out there be very if devoted to pro choice and for that it hit me like a ton of bricks couple of days ago on the program and it's been confirmed by the way that's the see I told you we'd been confirmed it is now beyond just a educated theory of mine there were protests in the NFL again last night the NFL game last night there were protests but you know what nobody sought you know why because the TV networks than televised you know why because the NFL is losing this thing and the players are losing this thing and there's no more power no longer is there and the strength no longer is there any advantage for the drive by media and the NFL and the Players Association to televise players disrespecting the anthem the fact that they fought that was a good thing for them politically shows how out of touch they are there's no reason there's no other reason why the media the networks and the players and the league all got together and televised all of these anthems to Scholl all of these protests the kneeling their refusal to honor the flag they thought they were relating to a majority of Americans I'm telling you their warped in their view of what the American population is and who they are and they are learning again they learned it on election night two thousand sixteen they are learning it watching this Hollywood Weinstein story unfold and now they're learning it they're learning it in the economy by the way with public sentiment on the economy at a near record high consumer sentiment on U. S. in the U. S. is unexpectedly high on expat because they have no idea they think you are out there scrounging around in poverty because trump's president because Obama is no longer there and that the government isn't doing enough to care enough about the poor and the downtrodden people are starving they are so out of touch the disconnect between the media and people inside the Washington bubble and the people in the rest of the country is it it this disconnect continues to expand hell no there's no reason they televise those protests they televised the raised fist they televised players taking in the why because it was anti American in the media just stops that up anything anti America like black lives matter or anti fur or whatever happens in Ferguson Missouri or Baltimore anything when they take cameras and a little pizzeria in Indiana and ask them if they would cater a gay wedding and the answer is no they think they're on the case they think a majority of Americans are as disgusted with America as they are and they quickly learn they are in the minority there's only one reason I stopped televising the protests the kneeling and all this during the anthem it was hurting it was not advancing the cause and they'll tell you what little differently we'd never televised via the normally we only did this because it was knows wrong you started televising this stuff because it fit your sentiment that there is trouble in America that America's imperfect that America's impure or that America's racist sexist bigot homophobe here's evidence you couldn't wait to televise and you made the mistake that that was the sentiment of a majority of people watching the NFL and boy did you blow that now they're not televise it that's their solution to the problem and another another thing I thought would be all over the media yesterday but they really must be a self focused I had the perfect solution the perfect crisis management idea for Harvey Weinstein you remember it Mr certainly all yeah well guess what once removed it's happened it actually has happened once removed my idea for perfect crisis manager the perfect higher for hire Harvey OneNote tales and filling in the blanks or coming up I mean a couple headlines here for those of you in the climate change crowd that first one is from ice age now from yesterday NASA confirms sea levels are falling across the planet NASA's own graphs and charts are reproduced here and they demonstrate that sea levels are falling where's that water going it's being locked up on land as snow and ice sea levels are falling this is not supposed to happen according to the climate change models this next story is very sad how many of you have ever watched one of these up videos and their numerous now that Richard Attenborough narrated a couple they're produced by the BBC and they show you various at planet earth one of those one of these episodes featured one of the most astounding things I have ever seen and it involves penguins and the birth of a new pic was there there there give exit my hatch and if this is the most amazing thing in Antarctica to protect all of the eggs laid a colony of penguins will Hubble Hayden thousands of them in Beverly called in humanly survivable temperatures for months to protect those eggs since penguins cannot tell each other apart by look because they all look the same each penguin has a different voice for lack of a better way they all each kind one has a different they made and the maids recognize each other by the sound of their chirping or what but the video they had these filmmakers they're down there and they're in their heated tents and whatever and these penguins thousands of thousands of in bitterly cold snow and wind sheltering and protecting each other and the eggs and they rotate out so that those on the outside giving the brunt of the weather eventually move end to be protected and those on the inside gravitate out well given that thousands of penguin check in Lonestar checks babies are starving in Antarctica mass starvation has wiped out thousands of penguin chicks in Antarctica you know why unusually thick see I use is forcing the parent penguins to forage further for food in what conservationists today called a catastrophic breeding with failure French scientists supported by the world wildlife fund been studying a colony of eighteen thousand pairs of penguins in east Antarctica since two thousand ten scoreboard only two checks survived the most recent breeding season earlier this year and they attribute the disaster to extensive sea ice now how can that be happening if there's climate change down the polar ice caps are melting well they aren't and the sea levels are not rising they are falling and once again evidence arrives that totally blows in massive holes through the widening made up political con Karzin of climate change I. E. global warming we start on the farms today with robin Colorado springs great to have you Sir how you doing they rushed Yamaha radio find anti thank you I wanted to speak to you about net neutrality not being a millennial I have friends who are still scared that evil corporations are going to regulate the internet now that net neutrality is not going to happen now is wandering if you can give me a brief synopsis of why we don't want net neutrality that I can give to my millennial friends have to wind it of me trying to explain it all the time happily but I guarantee you they're not going to accept what you tell them is true unless you through it use the words a stain ability somewhere in your answer but first I just ended up interviewing for the next issue of my newsletter Thomas Hayes look he's a professor of fire up the broadcast spectrum lay communications factories and expertise written a book called the political spectrum it's in lay terms to explain the history of regulation over the spectrum radio TV it to Wayne Anderson that internet wireless cellular and all of that so that people can understand exactly what has and has not happened here is that here it is in a nutshell net neutrality as advocated by the people that your friends like and support is asking for big government to regulate it corporations don't regulate things they compete if the federal government that regulates and your pals are seeking that your pals believe government enforces fairness and equality and sameness and that's not at all what's going to happen in the history of the spectrum is all the proof that you need the internet up until two or three years ago when people started getting crazy about net neutrality the internet is not one communications medium that was not regulated and look at how it expanded and look at how free it was rob the New York Times The Washington Post you name it enter the internet and everything is free they're charging their subscribers the same thing but on the internet it was free everything was everybody got on board there wasn't any regulation there wasn't any limitation you can go it was the wild west it was the it was the essence of customer and market freedom the do you know when cellular technology was invented I can't say I do well would you be surprised to learn that it was first invented in nineteen forty well it was suppressed by the government in collusion with broadcast communities broadcast companies to keep it from coming to market until the nineties while the mid early to mid eighties late eighties actually F. M. radio was invented and shall hold for thirty years by a consortium of the government and any M. broadcasters who did not want competition net neutrality would equal the government making partnerships with various corporations based on the politics of the president and the administration at the time and they would make deals to benefit the corporation you do not want the government involved in this at all if you want a free internet if you want an internet that's going to be affordable at what rate you have the ability to pay if you want different tiers but if you want the internet to become your cable companies that support net neutrality rob if you're out there alone out delve into this a little bit more have to hurry through that but you got the essence of it if you go back to Rush Limbaugh dot com is re read that you'll be up to speed ball spends more on about it  |||||||||| welcome to today's edition although rush twenty four seven podcast something dramatic crucial an extraordinary has just happened ladies and gentleman it just happened mere moments before and this program again the timing certainly not coincidental it happened at the White House it involves the president of the United States and a pen and what happened was a first serious slice taken out of obamacare sprite senator John McCain's best efforts to thwart the president trump and preserve this boondoggle the president's triumph here at this stage greeting great to have your eight hundred two eight two two eight eight two if you want to be on the program and I know you do the email address in a rush moment EIB net dot U. S. before we get to this just something I have to observe as a step up on a few people have seen us and I've seen it twice now two different stories one of them from a supposedly a conservative columnist who never was and is not demonstrated that she isn't that will be Jennifer Rubin people are beginning to invoke perhaps they say of the necessity of the twentieth there for the men but you know what the twenty Fifth Amendment it twenty five amendment basically it has the cabinet gets together and votes on whether or not the president is competent to serve and if not they vote him out of office and there's a line of succession that would assume power this happens and more and more people are well it's it's it's too that I've seen it maybe more than that are now saying that we're on the verge of need this because trump is truly losing his mind trump is wandering around aimlessly in the White House with no frenzies muttering to the photos on the wall his lost it and is on the verge of losing it completely the evidence they cite is the president demanding to increase our nuclear arsenal my ten fold despite everybody involved in this denying it this of course is the springboard to trump supposedly being called a moron by secretary of state killer sin which then landing trump suggesting it all online IQ tankan just wean him and tell us in in which he would win well the left not finding any evidence what so ever and now scraping the bottom of the barrel with the trump dot CA can't find any evidence of collusion between trump on the Russians are now grasping at every straw if everybody's losing their minds out there it is the left and this Harvey Weinstein story on top of everything else that's causing them to lose their minds is now speeding the process of them going crazy and we're witnessing the left break down and go nuts right before our very eyes but there are these two references I've seen and the drive bys all it takes is one drive by to pick up it'll be amplified like I told you yesterday early I told you yesterday that my comments on trumpeting NFL we're gonna be purposely taken out of context I told all of you did that would be taken out of context I told all of you I know exactly what would happen and I mean slowly walks in here before anybody had left yesterday so it's already happened he showed me a story from hill dot com when I totally took out of context what are they left out a very crucial aspect to what I said there is the drive bys are eager to report that as a staunch trump us like me might be breaking from trump I'm not breaking from trump I didn't indicate that I was breaking from trump so desperate to report it next so excited they will even when out fonts and conservative Republican strategist on TV to confirm it to tell me how brilliant I was as a is it is a means of learned trying to encourage me to keep breaking from trump why don't all the trumps losing his mind they have never thought he had won but the reason I mention all this in the trunk was on hand in the last night did any of you in their watch trumpet handed me last night well I saw a little bit of it I didn't see anybody out of it I saw somebody completely relaxed and confident certainly not sitting on the edge of your seat worried I didn't see Humphrey Bogart juggling the marbles I didn't see anything of the sort and then we have the ceremony at the White House this morning were trumped takes a huge slice out of obamacare I saw relaxed guy laughing and having fun as he was last night on may Hannity show we don't have yeah I mean behavioral evidence that would indicate trumps losing his mind it's all found in the drive by media and it replied it's reported in the drive by media by anonymous sources inside the White House sources close to secretary met sources close to the secretary Tilson Thomas and sources close that do not wish to go on the record because since it can but in the nature of the allegations being levelled and so forth just don't see any evidence of but it's out there now and Jennifer Rubin's face today where she writes where now she's been the Wall Street journal I guess that's right you live in Washington post a so called conservative blogger when do we reach the twenty Fifth Amendment territory and there's one other reference is it may be over here well yeah I think there's a story on drudge that's not headline to but it mentions it in the story if you watch trump this morning besought trump last night you see trumpet any time %HESITATION it doesn't appear to be anybody under a dark cloud to me it seems to me that all the trumps opponents of the ones cracking up I mean it the suicide watches out on leftists not us certainly not on trump Harvey Weinstein storage Sheesh disease I mean Hollywood there even shocked that somebody could fall this fast I don't I learn well I know that don lemon is losing his mind at sea they're all losing their minds over there they're losing their minds everywhere that all of this is happening to them look at what is rearing its head these people have fought they argue applied the moral high ground actual harassers in the abusers of women were exclusively all on the right well those stories are few and far between but on the left you've got teddy Kennedy you got Bill Clinton now you got wind steam you've got Anthony Weiner Carlos danger in any number of other actors on the left and so many theories that I have that developed two in my mind explaining and all of this are now presenting themselves %HESITATION in front of everybody's eyes I mean they just they think they have the moral purity of the day proper respect for women and you look on the left and and the serial abusers and rapists and the perverts are all found on their site at least a significant number of the mark while these people have told themselves that they are clean and pure as the wind driven snow and they're reaching I think their wit's end at their inability to get rid of trial I mean they thought they'd get this done inside of a month or two I really do I think they thought they believe that they believe the stuff they believe their own V. S. I'm sure they believe that trump colluding with the Russians I'm sure they believe put installing election I'm sure they believe they've gotten themselves so immersed in it they believe that's not mentally healthy and as they believe a succession of these crazy things and then they not come to pass then they get even crazier and not here and this isn't trump trump is not the one that appears with a dark cloud over him no matter how the drive bys wanna spend things up what I see makes me refute everything the drive bys are reporting about trump state of mind it seems to me to be with her involved knowledgeable relaxed happy that's trump's post to be miserable you know nobody supposed to be able to withstand this kind of them withering assault day after day after day after day for over a year everybody's should have crumbled by now certainly nobody should be thriving at the end of it nobody should be happy up beat termin doesn't let go I think probably trump supporters get more depressed than he does over day to day events so let's go to the audio sound bites you tell me what you hear this is the signing ceremony today executive order to promote health care choice and competition we have two bites of this is the first in a few moments I will sign an executive order taking the first steps to providing millions of Americans with obamacare relief it directs the department of health and Human Services treasury and the department of labor to take action to increase competition increased choice and increase access to lower priced high quality healthcare options and they will have so many options this will cost the United States government virtually nothing we don't care people will have great great health care and when I say people I mean by the millions and millions and here's the next and the last bite that we have I'm also directing secretary accustomed to consider ways to expand these associations and these healthcare plans all across state lines very goes to create tremendous competition there you go transformative in so many ways change aimed at creating more and lower prices for millions of Americans there you go competition will be staggering there you go insurance companies will be fighting to get every single person signed up and you will be hopefully negotiating negotiating negotiating and you'll get such low prices for such great care alright salt before getting into the nitty gritty I happen to be watching flax knows when this was over and they had some leftist on there who was reading he was on with them while he was I don't even know this guy never saw it before doesn't mean this guy's reading well he's reciting talking points and you should hear well this is this it goodbye coverage for for pre existing conditions a president who just did toward that the poor are going to lose their health insurance the wealthy you're going to get a judgment was just monolithic formula like Eric cliche and talking any info Babe was Melissa Francis she got frustrated listeners guy finally cut him off and said you didn't see what everybody else flaw then read read Rollins came out now he just spouting talking points and I was fuming you could see a moment camel is still on him but he wasn't speaking they tried to go through it again after ed Rollins vanished and Melissa friend Louise got degree to disagree because you didn't watch what we saw it didn't matter what trump said the left has their reaction to this now here are the basics and some things I mean that that that that the pictures of this recount of incredible ram Paul came up with the shell of this idea was introducing it up and and Mike pence the vice president rand Paul praised Tromp for baldness and leadership rand Paul when it comes to obamacare has been from the beginning of this opposed to anything that didn't literally get rid of obamacare and all these previous health care bills that some of them started on me house the ones that had their origins in the Senate he wasn't eager about any of them because in his mind it didn't really change anything other than cosmetically but he's all aboard on this and I think this I'd it has the potential to be a a huge deal now it's not everything and it can't be everything would just an executive order or executive action but it's something and it's more than we were ever going to get if we had left it up just to the Senate or just a house what the executive order will do is erase existing rules on small businesses banding together to buy health insurance through what are known as association health plans it will lift limits on short term health insurance plans according to and administration sources and it will directly the order here directs the department of labor to modernize rules to allow small employers to create association health plans let me translate this for you when all this news media speak means problem with Obama well one of the many problems is that healthy people are not buying it and the reason I'm not buying it's two fold it's wildly expensive it is your rationally expensive and it's a rationally expensive because the mandate in obamacare was going to force them to buy it and their purchases were going to fund healthcare for the poor and the elderly and others who couldn't afford it and saw the burden was on the young and healthy it never made any sense the young in a free market the young and healthy would not buy health insurance other than catastrophic because they're young and healthy they don't need it so the mandate was created requiring them to and they just didn't do it they opted to pay the fine or they just rolled the dice that the IRS couldn't catch up with all the other things the IRS has to do and so there wasn't any where near on Nov money coming in to fund it at the at the front end or the back end obamacare and it led to a whole lot of people without insurance this change will allow for the market to begin creating policies that match the need and desire of customers meaning they're going to be allowed crawled the existing policies are re write new ones that only offer X. coverage of this this coverage that coverage not mandate universal coverage for every damn thing that a young twenty five year old guy will never need like contraception coverage not going to be required to buy this kind of stuff the insurance companies will now be three you create policies that actually featured things people want and on the theory of competition is such that as the number of insurance companies play the game then they're going to be in competition with one another to get those dollars and the policies will have to be reflective of the market and desires and then cost will lower because of the competition small employers will be allowed to a form their own groups to create association health plans and qualify for group coverage based on their needs and their desires now the left is just having a cow over all of this the politico it's not yet clear how far the administration all know how quickly it can implement the president's order but if successful the new rules could opt in the way businesses and individuals buy coverage lowering premiums for the healthiest Americans at the expense of key consumer protections and potentially tipping the obamacare markets into a tailspin know it already is in a tailspin it makes no sense Warren they healthiest and youngest Americans to be paying with almost they won't buy it they're not in the market therefore none of their purchases get factored into the total amount of money in the world treats people who are in need of it obamacare was designed to fail just this why it is so that the demand for single payer would be met much easier Karen Paulette seniors fellow Kaiser family foundation used to work for Obama said within a year of this would kill the market no no no it will kill area as another aspect of obamacare that is being rolled back short term health insurance plans trump administration are is going to end Obama you're right restrictions on short term health insurance plan they were not legal under obamacare short term plans allow insurers self stop gap policies which don't cover pre existing conditions or mental health services and a whole lot of other costly things in other words you're going to be able to go by what you want and not be forced to buy a bunch of things that will never affect you you're not gonna have to help pay for example for pre existing conditions if you don't have one you're gonna be able to go out and buy it a weird policy and the coverage could extend for as long as a year current limit is three months on these kinds of policies people can't make plans on three months a year is a little bit more time until you figure out where in the market place you want to be as a buyer who you know I think ladies and gentlemen we're getting very very close here to needing a new ribbon color to signify women abused by Harvey Weinstein to more a French actress and now Kate Beckinsale has %HESITATION move forward here and she is the latest actress to come forward with a story about Harvey Weinstein who has now been accused of sexual harassment by over thirty women Beckinsale wrote on Instagram morning that winds steam first came on to her when she was seven team and that she believes even now that rejecting him hurt her career because I was called me Harvey Weinstein at the Savoy hotel when I was seventeen I assumed it would be in a conference room which was very common when I arrived reception told me to go to his room he opened a door his bathrobe I was incredibly naive and young and it didn't cross my mind that this older unattractive fat guy would expect me to have any sexual interest in him after declining alcohol in announcing I had school in the morning I left on the easy but unscathed a few years later Kate Beckinsale avid that Weinstein asked her if she had tried the anything if if he had tried anything with her in that first meeting %HESITATION I realized he couldn't remember if you have assaulted me or not what does she look like so many others she says she had to continually reject Weinstein's advances over the years and that he threatened her and others are simply up to thirty now and and I'll take there's there's there's collateral damage here Matt Damon %HESITATION Ben Affleck and all of these wacko you wear a collar about this yesterday all these late night comedians none of them covered the story just like and be seed didn't covered the story they sent Ronan Farrow down to the New Yorker and everybody's now to see why a mode trying to come up with a lie Ying excuses that people might believe but they're not going to fool anybody I I tell you this this is it is a very good said yesterday this is a great opening was a wide opening great opportunity to continue to prosecute the culture war in terms of identifying what liberalism is Kazmir Harvey who's ahead why it's a good question is getting close I mean I think we have more names associated with wine stain now the difference in the two is that Cosby's women largely unknown to anybody but Harvey's women are all actresses in major well known now public figures and and %HESITATION they don't they're all of a type they're all actresses so forth but in terms of the numbers %HESITATION I don't really know the Obama's in this you know folks this is really it gets more and more curious and I think the other day I mean as I told her ninth here we are at the twelfth so it was either Monday or Tuesday I opened the program with a heartfelt belief that one of the reasons this was happening obvious is that Hillary Clinton lost but they gave Ted Kennedy a pass and why lie and of the Senate he was right on the abortion he was a leader of liberalism in the Senate so it was worth preserving even in nineteen sixty nine and then of course Bill Clinton they were they might want to all costs to defend Bill Clinton in the process they literally ripped the entire foundation of feminism right out from under it and it sent a signal of this is the key thing I believe it sent a signal to other liberal guys and other guys that may not have been liberal at the time that if you are right on the issues you've got to get out of jail card if you are right and particularly on abortion if you'll make it well known that you believe in a woman's right to choose and even if you don't care and even if your belief honest belief is the opposite doesn't matter you say that is the one thing that matters to you most and it is a get out of jail card it buys you insurance from being held accountable for any of this behavior you can even if you wanted to you could even take us back to JFK and Camelot were the same kind of stuff was going on in the White House then in the media coverage out created just this this image of Camelot at the suggestion of Jackie Kennedy after of course the the assassination OB but but throughout history that that that the fact is that liberal media has gone out of its way to cover up this kind of behavior and isn't it ironic that this kind of behavior resides in the party that claims to be on altered we portrait of all of women's rights be it workplace ugh %HESITATION of a postal workplace violence opposed to rape opposed to sexual abuse sexual arm what any of these kinds of things that that that did the bottom line is that most of this has been going on inside that party and that party is where it is supposedly believe that women's rights are paramount why raise the belief yes how much of this is even real how much of these guys in Hollywood actually are liberals when the purpose of Hollywood is to get girls and then doing whatever you have to do and being whatever you have to be in order to get girls if you think that you got to be pro choice and if you think you have to be supportive of every wacko feminist because if that's what it takes to succeed in Hollywood and to get girls then that's what you'll go whether you believe it or not I think that explains a lot of it I don't know how much but its phoniness is the bottom line what it has led to is that all of the truly are the vast majority of the truly abusive anti women behavior actually exists and takes place in liberalism among people on the left who all hands an immunity from it it's kinda like it's all the same lines as Bill Gates or the Kennedys or Warren Buffett always being in favor of tax increases for people like them what better way is there to keep the hordes from your mote demanding to get into your house and take everything you've got if you can convince them that you think you're not paying enough taxes and that you support tax increases for the rich then you will be left alone and not only will you be left hall you'll probably be supported so Bill Gates profit %HESITATION any number of wealthy people has it always surprise you you hear all these wealthy people claim they think they're not taxed enough or claim that they're eager to support tax increases on the rich and it seems to make no sense they didn't get rich by paying high taxes why do they want to start paying high taxes now the bottom line is they don't they're simply saying Celtic keep people away from I keep the hordes to people with the pitch forks to keep a bother and somebody else Kennedy's pulled this off Kennedy is maybe the greatest example of this kind of phoniness here you have this well that was generated from all the way back in the Great Depression the import duty on Scotch which they continue to derive today %HESITATION the Chicago merchandise Mart old man Kennedy selling short on purpose which is perfectly fine but it destroys people in the process all this massive wealth was created in the Kennedy family is what care only about pork and a down rod and that's all they talk about in women's issues came along and they're supportive of prole choice and women's this and women's that meanwhile Ted Kennedy behaves as he behaved tend to Bill Clinton behaved as he did how much of this so called policy believe on the left is actually genuine versus how much trouble is a construct for other purposes will this to me is the opportunity we have here yeah and delving deeper into the culture war and explaining why the people who are literally doing the greatest damage to it are somehow exempted from any of that and get away with blaming people who are not destroying the culture I a server names and then there's a story here on the Obama's %HESITATION headline disgusted Obama's were star struck by Harvey Weinstein's access and cash the Obamas relationship with the movie producer so Washington times the Obamas relationship of the movie producer went beyond campaign cash Mr wine Stephen arrange for Mrs Obama either make a surprise appearance at the Oscars as a presenter in two thousand thirteen the live audience in Hollywood gasped and applauded when Michelle my Belle dressed in a shimmering silver gown was being done to a screen at the venue to make the presentation for Best Picture Weinstein was giving area presentation Harvey was at a film school one day and he had a piece of advice for the students he said I never let anybody tell me now even the White House never let anybody tell me no now who do you think would be the person who could be of greatest service in helping casting couch movers and shakers navigate this crime who out there because if it's Harvey Weinstein there's a got to be a lot of other and you gotta know we know what's already Matt Damon we know Ben Affleck and there have to be others quaking in their boots who should they call for no no they don't call Bill Clinton not all no no no no no I understand that need jerk response and reaction Hillary Clinton is the export in navigating the situations and having men accused of this stuff so far dead serious my friends Hillary Clinton is C. E. all and chief operating officer of bimbo eruptions ink Hillary Clinton may have finally found a way to appropriately reconnect with supporters especially in Hollywood here what a great service Hillary could provide to the movers and shakers in Hollywood casting couch Gade he's an expert in these situations there's no she's almost cheated on me woman in America and every guy that's ever done it has prospered and try almost and has never paid the price she is an expert at this Harvey and his people run around and you try to hire crisis PR firms in all at but don't skimp Hillary has a price it may be expensive but time has shown that it is worth it what are you laughing at and there is certainly well all good comedy is comedy because there's an element of truth in it rats why your life by the way Bill Cosby fifty seven women on record Harvey Weinstein within twenty eight and thirty Hillary Clinton has led the most successful war on women ever and in the process she saved her husband's name his career of his presidency and the Democrat party tell me how Harvey could do any better you could hardly was a bully you ain't seen nothing yet from your higher Hillary wait now and she takes the money we know that too in time it it be talking about silencing women preserving the viability of a serial sexual predator Hillary Clinton is the gold she is the greatest of all time there's nobody in her league don't call Jeff Epstein don't call Bill Clinton don't colleague called the woman that showed everybody how it's done and after doing it you still get heap big praise in the media and so will she Hillary Clinton single handedly could put every crisis PR firm out of business if she would take on Harvey Weinstein is a quiet and work her magic show me one time where it hasn't worked you can't in terms of silencing women and destroying their reputations and preserving the viability of a serial sexual predator Hillary Clinton is unmatched she is the greatest of all time when you found it and they're gone should I go to graze of all time that's what the acronym as and mid it Hollywood you need Hillary now more than ever make the move the New York times is waiting to write the story NBC would love to to get this whole Ronan Farrow embarrassment off their web page in their network so the funds quickly Jared in Quincy Illinois great to have you on the EIB network Sir how are you doing IBM great rush armed with a comment about this our media and %HESITATION Harvey wincing stuff it it's really kinda unusual in but not unpredictable that you're heaping praise on all these women who were used I call them in the media says incredibly brave when in fact many sat on this story fifteen or twenty years and a lot of the serial what use and other women to be abused based on their silence %HESITATION it and I can foresee a time maybe like at the Oscars were all these women will be called to the stage with us course standing ovation and I'm not blaming them but I'm just saying they're not you're not a hero that heroes are the ones who are willing to sacrifice a role in a movie stop abuse and there is a very very few of those in Hollywood unfortunately now I have to say this is a fascinating proposition you're you're you're you're making a point you're not trying to vilify these women you just don't understand why in the world are being called brave when they all waited for somebody else to come forward right yes rush yes Harvey Weinstein is destroyed that after the first things came out once he was destroyed there's no bravery coming out I mean David that's piling on I mean I can see why they would do it but the brave the brave was the were the people that but we are you know and what is not even aimed at the women it's at the people in the media and elsewhere who are attaching that label to them of course they'll accept it %HESITATION though they don't take the label brave and run with it and then there except the fact that they work you're good it's a good point to good but where was the bravery where is the bravery where's the bravery when it's already out there and there's a bunch of piling on good good I'm glad you cut through today I take a break because we're out of precious busy broadcast moments there are more now look I do think that one reason why these woman what women would not come forward what their testimony against Harvey Weinstein and that's one reason it once again is Hillary Clinton these women have to know what happen to Paula Jones and what happened Monica Lewinsky and all the others tried to be brave poor little |||||||||| welcome to today's edition although rush twenty four seven podcast okay folks a point that I have been making forum practically the entire twenty nine years were doing this program it is now valid once again I have become aware of some thinking on our side your buddies from if you don't why did The New York Times finally dump on poor Harvey why you'll believe you won't believe how theory gaining ground out there you want the theory is by the way greetings welcome Rush Limbaugh EIB network all of the IBM microphone telephone number eight hundred two eight two two way that to them theory is and it's gaining ground yes that Harvey is taking one for the team that all of this is being done on purpose in order for the media to then be justified in focusing on and in snaring trump that Harvey Weinstein the left went to Harvey we need to you know to really bite bite the big one here for the team we need you to really take a big big bullet but when it's all over will explain to everybody that you word that ninety percent of this isn't true and that you did this to finally help everybody get rid a truck and our people and I said to believe that now stop well let me illustrate what this actually would me if this theory is true after in snaring trump the New York times and Ronan Farrow and Ben Affleck and all of the women Ashley drug you name would throw a party for Harvey in thank for having his reputation permanently destroyed just to enable the left to get trump and to get even what what happen to poor Hillary and then they'll tell us that ninety percent of the stuff about hardy was all be as all in the service of getting rid of trumpeting Hillary in Obama's and throw a gigantic fund raiser starring Harvey and his wife who will have come back to him Georgina Chapman Gwyneth Ashley and Angelina headlining is that the people on our side really think that's what's going on here what does that tell you it tells you that people on our side are permanently feeling defensive and incompetent and thinking the left is unbeatable and out smarting us at every turn and that we are constantly falling for this this kind of of defensiveness I am an assumption that the left is controlling everything I'm as I say it's not widespread but I'm seeing this theory and versions of it %HESITATION advance %HESITATION kind of rapidly out there so I was talking about this with somebody before the program in Iran by that might my that vision here of this giant fundraiser starring Harvey where everybody admits that ninety percent of it was B. S. and she said to me look be careful because every time you make jokes about these people end up coming true I said come on there is I was looking at the blog colleague at the times of Israel blog and the best explanation for why this has happened is right here ready why the New York times is suddenly taking down Harvey Weinstein after all these years and everybody knew it everybody knew it the story is not well Harvey had journalists on the payroll Harvey and publicity agents on the payroll heartbeat how did Harvey have any money left if he was paying everybody in Hollywood to keep a secret and maybe he didn't have anyone who knows but here is this from the times of Israel blog so the question it's a big one room why did the New York times suddenly find it necessary to violate the conspiracy of silence and share this information on page one only now can either be because barely a month ago Weinstein announced his plan to direct a movie based on Lian your **** epic Warsaw Ghetto novel mela eighteen can it be there goes Weinstein despite his bleeding heart liberalism despite his having trouble truckloads of dollars into the Obama coffers spike is why and if obedience the Clinton corruption machine could be that wine esteem finally crossed the Israel hating Israel hating New York times redline and declared himself a Zionist and lover of Israel now before you owe me that's far more believable than this cockamamie theory that Harvey's taking a bullet for the team here does any of that Harvey taken a bullet for the team resonate with you don how about with you I mean that's absurd now this the New York times doesn't like it Netanyahu they don't like %HESITATION Israeli politics everybody's confused by that because the New York times' ownership been Jewish from day one the editors Walden Jewish so what you know why are so many Hollywood leftist anti Israel it's been a question that the people been asking %HESITATION M. M. answers deep and confusing if you don't know not able to go there but this explanation something has caused this and I'll tell you something else to be on the lookout for now that media everybody realizes the damage being done here the damage being done to Hillary the damage being done to the Obamas the damage being done to the to the primary influential culture motivational shaper entity in America Hollywood the damage here being done is incredible and this this there's gonna have to be pushed back to this somehow now you you factor trumps momentum like the Supreme Court threw out the challenge to his travel bag it's gone the Emmett F. L. has the footprint of Donald trump's shoe on its corporate net today and we're gonna get into this in great detail as the program unfolds the our trump is going to announce by by way of executive action executive order a major throw away all of obamacare that has the left in a tizzy today the left is losing elections trump does not have his own party helping move the agenda but trump isn't giving up on trump is moving forward we talked about this in great detail yesterday this is what pushing back looks like salt given trump momentum and it is there and given the implosion in Hollywood and of primary formed lasers and donors to the Clintons in Obama's we have to be on the lookout for a media led narrative check now I'm not doubling back here to this cockamamie theory that Harvey Weinstein is taking a bullet for the team but we have seen in early attempts at this media narrative shift already by trying to equate trump with wine stain and vice versa that isn't sticking but they're not gonna give that up there's another attempt at this by Tina brown today who says the real problem in the Weinstein story is it somebody just like him is still in the White House and bill Clinton's name never appears in her story so they're in this narrative shift in there in that they're in the process of trying to take the heat I mean it's a salacious story it's good for clicks it's good for him it's good for grabbing and holding an audience but the damage being done by this thing is going way beyond all hardy I mean that if it to its its encompassing pretty much all of them god like figures that make up the left so the attempt here to equate trump with Weinstein we'll probably continue I don't think it's good I don't think they can shift the narrative I don't because the one thing they're never going to be able to do is separate trumps voters from trump only trump can do that and there's only one way truck could do that and that is if trump is seen is joining the swamp then his his his base is gone and trump's not gonna join us want but if it looks like he is that's going to be the first Fisher or crack between trump supporters to let the media do their narrative shifting all they want I don't think they're going to have any success in not in equating Harvey Weinstein with with trump's height they tried that the NBC access Hollywood tape they thought they already had a trumpet he escaped with no fingerprints whatsoever out of that if they try to go back to that I mean that's just the definition of insanity doing something over and over again expecting a different result but I'm telling you there discombobulated it might appear they're having fun with this for awhile but believe me they realize the damage that they are helping along here by the continual coverage of the Harvey story Harvey supposedly charter had some donor putting on a private plane last night for Europe to go to sex additional rehab sex addiction rehab somewhere in now in Europe and so that's the target I got Harvey out of the country but well there's all kinds of sex rehab places in America where the media can hunt you down what the media would do the media somebody from take your pick the Enquirer people does America where did Harvey's wife announce her leaving her house peep people magazine yeah you call people magazine shouldn't call New York times she didn't call women's wear daily or the bridal registry she called people magazine to announce the way it happens is let's say the rumors out that Harvey checks in there's all kinds these places and now so it's hardly checksum or would take is some member the media trying to check in as a sex at and actually get in there %HESITATION as as %HESITATION suppose would patient so that's why I'm they're getting Harvey out of the car he may not because what was and it does make it be saying why did that that I know that the stories of brother turned a man %HESITATION family rivalry %HESITATION I'm just throwing out the the the the times of Israel Blogg odd because you know what would make the New York times turn they have destroyed all be back as two thousand four don't forget and they've been sitting on it since two thousand former buddy has Ronan Farrow having this story took it to NBC NBC said you don't like what you have here isn't reportable Robinson well yeah it is okay any walk down the street to the New Yorker who would look at in less than thirty minutes now going back then be see why did you spike it why did well when you brought your words it wasn't very reportable anybody's remember what Lorne Michaels that well we did twenty Harvey jokes on Saturday Night Live does is a New York guy yeah how well so's trump and %HESITATION and it hasn't stopped in to see me Obama's apology I have the Obama's atomic theory that my formerly nicotine stained fingers what I'd do with it or not that my stacks out of order because of an earlier era it's coming up right here leave it to you I'm not going to play the audio in only to voters audio up wrong page I thought I had it because it looks identical here it is is what the Obama's Michelle and I have been disgusted by the recent reports about Harvey Weinstein is something strikes you about that why it why are they disgusted by the reports why are they discussed that by their behavior you mean you're not disgusted by it the guy you're not disgusted by the behavior and what is this recent reports Barack and Michelle all Michelle I have been disgusted not all are have been but were over it now Scott stood by the recent reports about Harvey Weinstein so it's the reports that it's the media that disc not hardly and not what he did then the next line any man who demeans and degrades women in such fashion needs to be condemned and held accountable regardless of wealth or status and me man now we're talking about the Obamas friend and benefactor there's no need to make this about any man it's about a man it's about a guy that you can't specify that they're upset with Harvey they've gotta include Harvey and that they don't mention bill Clinton's name here obviously winds steam has been condemned wired the Obama so late to the party into the Obamas want wine Steve held accountable they should call out my name those are covered up for it but they won't do that if far if people like Matt Damon and Ben Affleck and people are wondering what's the big deal with that well they're they're only we don't know who they are because their first movie good will hunting it was why Xena did that Weinstein distributed that made it happen so they I mean everybody who makes it who has any decency at all never forget the people that made it possible and now they're that I'm that undoubtedly have some loyalty to one's to but they've been late to the party as as well just as the Obama's art of Matt Damon and Affleck are proven to have covered up for one's will the Obama's condemn that well I have to say in fact is our this is more likely to last tweet on the subject from the Obama's we should celebrate the courage of women who have come forward tells these painful stories what is this we we need don't celebrate that courage you don't Hollywood doesn't that's the whole point here you didn't celebrate bill Clinton's accusers and you still haven't name those in Hollywood have spoken out against Harvey Weinstein celebrate amount gore hadn't and and you have a party forum I mean rape and abuse of women is one of the biggest deals in the Democrat party the American lefties women for coming forward after all this time one of the heroines they remain nameless and we should work to build a culture including by empowering our girls and teaching our boy is decency and respect so that we can make such behavior less prevalent in the future not even now they're even committing to wiping out just making it less profit but the point is it was the bomb we have built that culture it is the distinct great American culture that Hollywood mocks impure ones and laughs at you and you would join them in that we have that culture it's called the bitter Clinger's and religion and guns we have built a culture that empowers our girls and teachers are boys do now I am I'm another question here by the way welcome back L. rush balmy evening and surpassing all audience expectations every day and here we are at a fast as we can maybe or Bradley and Wednesday I eight hundred two eight two two eight eight two Mister snidely is even now screening calls determining who among you are fit is fit do appear here on the nation's most listened to radio program I have a question about this Harvey business where are Republicans Republican leaders making hay out of this then and I don't mean joining in the assassination character whatever of Harvey Weinstein Arlene that me where is the Republican Party trying to take advantage of this that if this were a Republican to whom this was all happening all we would be seeing is whatever Democrats think and what this shows us about the Republican Party and conservatism and what Abacha whatever is they are where is the Republicans don't even play the game there's all kinds of points to be made here about phoniness about hypocrisy about these people claiming to be the great are Bridger's of culture and virtue in values and look at the every major Democrat Barack Obama Michelle Obama Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton tried to give Harvey Weinstein what he was asking those women for Obama's and then the Clintons gave Harvey what he was speaking from those women because he was don't bring money into the democratic political campaigns and causes and doing everything he could to defeat Republican go away fingers of the Democrat party all over might help with the Republicans pointed it out challenge on loan from Gaudin Rush Limbaugh serving humanity simply by being here I want to go back to something that happened yesterday on the program %HESITATION regarding the NFL when a caller from Worcester Massachusetts was really Wierd and he was %HESITATION it was on the warpath against the patriots and particularly owner the paper it's Robert Kraft %HESITATION in his point was that that in his opinion Robert Kraft very hypocritical because Robert Kraft is %HESITATION very devoted to building a sports franchises leagues and so forth in Israel and that if this were happening in Israel of players refused to stand for the Israeli national anthem prior to a contest or he would make them caller so it would force them to armed and the fact that he doesn't here are the facts and Robert Kraft doesn't make that happen here was supposedly supposedly meant that the wasn't done %HESITATION genuinely full fledged American I don't want to just repeat a couple things about this because it leaves again it leads him here to a new development I haven't spoken to Mister Kraft during this football season but I got to know him quite well a couple women maybe three years ago now and his late wife Myra and and they both became really really good friends and I can assure I just wanna tell everybody he is not at all the man that was portrayed by the collar yesterday and I'm not tackling the caller I mean this is sports and every fan has their opinions and so forth but on the way Mister craft which described that I'd never ever seen anything at all to indicate that that Mister Kraft is not full fledged one hundred percent pro United States pro America is a is even a trump ist our but there's another thing that I set yesterday in M. sifting through all of this that's happening when you when you when you edit this all down and when you get down to the bare essence of this there's there's a story today about how football is already dying in Los Angeles the rams can't attract if in fact this story said that may be because the rams don't wanna attract now there were injured trying to stay under the radar while they build their stadium what a bunch Akaka there's nobody in the NFL that's trying to lose money up until this season it was very hard to lose money in the NFL with a guaranteed money you get as a league as an owner from the television rights money but the Chargers are playing the LA charges in a twenty seven thousand seat stadium in they can't even put twenty five thousand people in there and most of the fans showing up on charges games are showing up for the visiting team anyway the story was how the NFL is in trouble in the number to market the NFL's in trouble everywhere twenty years it's the people playing the game that are causing it'll and I don't know that the league looks at it that way and I don't know that the owners look at it that way I think a lot of what's going on the NFL is as I said yesterday the people run that leading and many of the honors believe what they see on the media everyday just like the Democrats all during two thousand sixteen believe that Hillary was going to win in a landslide they believe their polls they believed their precious Nate silver and the crunching of big data they believed it all in and look what happened Hillary was never gonna win that election the dirty little secret is Hillary Clinton probably never in an honest poll was ever had maybe after the access Hollywood video for a couple of hours but Donald Trump was going to win that election going away Hillary getting campaign now this may sound radical to say but I firmly believe it but look at all of them they believed even as late as eight o'clock on election night that he she was going to win in a landslide because they believe this stuff I don't think the left the Democrats understand America anymore they have a they have a jaundiced aura an incorrect view of the beating heart of the pulse of this country they think it's made up of people who don't like Christianity who don't like the constitution it don't like the bill of rights you think America is an oppressive nation who think America is heralding an inequality and oppression and all this and racist and and that that I think they think a majority of Americans think that that's why they campaign that way that's why they they gonna win the last night the NFL owners think this way I think the people in that league don't have proper understanding of their own audience of their own fans not I know this sounds odd because just rush come on their business they can do audience research fan research surveys that got it now you would think but there's not a single thing that happened during this anthem protest that leads me to believe it's one of two things either they know who their audience is and they're unhappy about it and they're very comfortable with these players taken a knee and essentially going to the anthem apparently it's it's one of two things either they don't know where the majority of thinking on this issue is or they do now and they resent it and so they support efforts to ram it down your throat neither option sounds very smart because when you strip this all away people playing the game are the ones causing the damage they might like to try to blame trump but trump is not disrespecting the anthem and trump is not disrespecting the cops and trump is not disrespecting the military and the players may not think they are but you can't tell by looking their actions by supporting caper nickel clearly said he didn't like the cops that he thinks the country's racist a macabre race that's now these guys all stand up in support of Kaepernick now they want a backrub don't want not just respecting the flag yes you are and yes you are disrespecting the anthem the point is it's the people play in the game because it would damage that's why I say the owners don't want to do they're scared I mean they want you listen they want with it and they want their players to be happy and content they want their players to think the owners got their backs till they join them in this thereby angering the fans you can see what's happened to you the numbers you can see what's happening to sales tickets and memorabilia the other files in a world hurt right now and it's the people who play the game who are doing the primary damage the players that we okay so you're no rush it's good dealt with good old dad they that never got damage would Goodell's not doing other than supporting what the players are doing it all starts there no reason I mention this again the news hit writers the program ended yesterday that one fact we read the memo off Roger Goodell to the to the other teams to the executives the general managers in the president's where he finally essentially threw in the towel you know what let's to stand for the anthem and let's find another way for the players to register their %HESITATION social anger but what what's it metal stamping the anthem let's have your your teams all go out and stand for the anthem and this constitutes a trump win I don't care how you slice it it constitutes a trump when trump was never going to lose this in the United States of America even today the person standing up for the flag standing up for the military standing up for the cops is not going to lose the left has not taken over the country spike what the media makes it look like everyday now one thing I did mention yesterday was because it was Norton near the end of the program players are not going to be happy with what they when they got the memo that Goodell sends a memo to the owners and executive general manager saying let's get the players let's all stand up that's just that's gonna make this even worse emerald right here again in my formerly Nick Gerald McCoy of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers defensive lineman said he thinks there might be M. up roar if the players are forced stand for the national anthem he said I don't think guys are gonna like it I think it's going to be an up or if that happens because you're basically taking away a constitutional right to freedom of speech if you if guys want to have a peaceful protest I don't think it's right to take that away now this illustrates something else Mister McCoy has no idea what he's talking about but thinks he does the first amendment and the free speech clause are irrelevant to the story this is a work place event and his freedom of speech Hey I'm be abridged by his employer everyone's is every day and the constitution doesn't do you any good but they all think they have a constitutional right to free speech they don't own that stage they don't own that field so there is going to be even more protests from a corny indicates it could be him up war and I don't doubt that he's right I have to share one more thing with you there's a part of this story that starting to make me nervous and it's this I am very uncomfortable with the president of the United States being able to dictate the behavior and power at the behavior and and all of anybody that's not where they should be coming from trump is continually tweeting I know what he's doing I understand why he's doing it in his motives are pure don't misunderstand but I don't think that it is useful or helpful for any employee anywhere to be forced to do something because the government says they must that scares the hell out of me this should come from the league as it looks like Goodell wants it to this should the owners should be demanding this not the president the commissioner should be damned demanding this not the president we don't want the president being able to demand anybody that he's unhappy with the haven a White Sea requires that's scary to me even if the president somebody I happen to like this is a workplace issue it's the owners in the league let this get out of hand because they didn't know how to deal with it were afraid to and it if this is gonna be made to work players are going to have to be told who the boss is and are going to have to be given specific work place rules and regulations that they know has nothing to do with the constitution the first amendment freedom of speech if you want to work for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers you're gonna stand for the amp if you want to work for the Dallas Cowboys you're going to stand for the anthem but I'm really nervous if all that happens because the president make you can make it happen by forcing the owners but this is a slippery slope to me and it hit me awhile ago and crystallized last night %HESITATION trump is in the right don't misunderstand but no president should have dictatorial power over individual behavior a president should not be able to tell the owners of a business how their employees are going to act and what they're going to swear allegiance to and all that that's up to the owners to do and it's up to the owners to come up with a system of punishment if they are employees violate company policy like it is in any other business they don't on the stage they don't have a right to it there's is a privilege just like every employees whose you don't on where you work unless you do %HESITATION you're always subject to the rules guidelines and wishes of the people to do all your bills the NFL should be no different but when the NFL misjudges its audience and doesn't know who its audience and isn't the NFL's afraid of its players in the inmate start running the asylum and that's when the president does stand up because what he says about this is absolutely right on the money but it ought not be a a presidential dictate that make it can be involved in fixing it but it ought not be why all of a sudden people start snapping to and behaving accordingly this is this a local issue team if you me make a clarification I and I stand by what I said that that the whole business of trump or any president dictating what somebody thinks or dictating what somebody does though that the league should be doing this the individual owner should be doing that's their problem they can fix it why does trump have the power trump is not a dictator he is president we still have a constitutional Republic why does trump have this power why is the NFL why no because trump has the support of sixty three million Americans who voted for him and they're still with him trump is simply voicing the wishes the demands of a majority of Americans and that's what gives him the power we don't have a dictatorship and I don't ever want one but trump's that's what this trumps power derives from his supporters and his supporters are going to be there long after trump has served his two terms and is gone the trump international over in the oven Venice or whatever the next one is and that's what people in the Republican Party but it's better start getting through their head this movement pre David trumpets gonna survive trump anyway let me grab a call here before we run out of time Maryland in not Bellville Michigan glad you called how are you I'm fine rise nice to talk to you yeah I had a question you know during the women's March Ashley Judd got up on the podium issue is just this diatribe of all these horrible things outlandish things against trump right Cedeno trump so how can she suddenly after all these years about once I comment and and start complaining I'm thinking it doesn't make sense to me well guys see this it does if you'll are able to do what I wish somebody would do and that is understand politics is in everything that happens in Hollywood or happens on the news and it corrupt if it's left wing politics it corrupts you're actually right Ashley Judd was she she was wearing one of those points I hats but she was out there at that rally I absolutely nasty woman I that nasty when she went off one trouble what a reprobate he has and now we know that she'd know what a reprobate once he was but she didn't have any personal knowledge trump and yet she launched on trouble not knowing a thing about it other than what the news had told her and yet she's dead she stood mute on Weinstein for years precisely because it makes sense to me rush I think you've got it it's a conspiracy whatever allows the media to come back and bring up trump and that well they're gonna try but the reason she launched on wine stains because it became safe to and it became a safe too because she talked of The New York Times because she was a short they were going to run the story and it wasn't going to be just for so she wasn't going to be alone taking on this this powerful pick but it's still a great question I'm glad you called out of the dispute your you earned the honor what I saw yesterday that trump never admits defeat and never lets go with these things and he's back once again challenging freight noses suggesting Hawaii that challenge local television broadcast licenses owned my own network |||||||||||| welcome to today's edition of all rush twenty four seven plug dressing but you know that you are the Harvey Weinstein story that this it just gives building now three women who have accused him of rape and senator Yorker story by Ronan Farrow Ronan Farrow is the daughter of mia Farrow and member he used to do a show for a week on M. S. N. B. C. had never been on TV before he won the Cronkite journalism award after his first night on TV I'll never forget that Brian Williams is as we've been doing this for thirty years we have a one Jack whatever in this guy one night and he gets the Cronkite award anyways got the story and then this story exactly what I told you in this story you'll see all over it you'll see the names Roger ailes see the story and you'll see the names bill o'reilly you know the name you will not see an administrator is long eight thousand words I don't want to you know the name you won't see in this story Bill Clinton you do not see the name Bill Clinton in the story of Harvey wind steam at all Yemen New Yorker and you really have to look hard to find the name Bill Clinton and many of the other stories there's something got somebody tell me if you've heard this because I haven't has anybody heard anybody defending Harvey say come on it didn't affect the way Harvey did his job com law and everybody does it remember the old Bill Clinton defense we to you ever heard anybody say that in a heartbeat well you know Donna Karen came out and did defend Harvey until the blowback happened and then she walked it back claiming she was taken out of context let's listen let's grab audio sound bite number one this is by the way greetings and that out and welcome great to have you here folks I I there's a major story today that maybe underneath your radar that I want to get into later there is an increasing nothing to do with Weinstein during this stuff if it's to do with trump %HESITATION I'm seeing more and more stories and its related this whole porker snafu that trump really isn't president that Kelly and madness it until arson have seized the office and %HESITATION openly defiant Tromp one everything purpose of the stories is to put forth two propositions one of course that trump is a dangerous idiot white coworker says on the verge of starting World War three and Doug veterans of the swamp literally have to counter man him on virtually everything %HESITATION and of course the second aspect of the story is a constitutional crisis if that's really happening if the for example what if if the intelligence community people like the NSA and the CIA among those people and the military are actually running the country by defying trump then is there a constitutional crisis going on and I want to address those I as only I like him in due course and I promise you it's going to be the day this is not something that I will not have time to get to what I want to get this why in the steam is stuff out of all speaking of which we have a statement from Bill Clinton on this all he some house drain usually is omitted in all of these stories its arm candy like this thing from the New Yorker that just popped see else's name all over it you see all Rileys name all over it it's a story of three women accused winds dean of rape that's two more than accused Clinton of rape so I guess Hillary can take some solace in that but still you don't find bill Clinton's name in this order many of the other stories but Bill Clinton has a statement on the upcoming a rehabilitation of party no William Jefferson Clinton on the rehabilitation of Harvey Weinstein my fellow Americans I'm here today on behalf of an old family friend Harvey Weinstein who is right now making amends for some unfortunate come come on come on come on behavior but it will take some time now Harvey is an old dinosaur learning new tricks backed up pop trick number one Harvey shut the door all year sorry everyone in Hollywood loves Harvey's power and money and we will forgive and forget the fact that for a moment he lost control of himself and acted like Donald Trump for twenty or thirty years thirty years Sir he will be a changed man respects women for whom writing are not for their trick number two white until you are rehabilitated to do it again William Jefferson Clinton on the re habilitation efforts of RV winds did that was obviously produced in a hotel suite somewhere it's great to have you here fonts as well off amber or running on another three hours of broadcast excellence here's Donna Karen Donna Karen's a good friend of Barbra Streisand I'm just gossiping here throwing things out there but I know she starred in the Donna Karen clothing line DKNY and and what she essentially sent him a statement last night Jews at the at the at some fashion film awards if vingt and she spoke with reporters about allegations sexual harassment against Harvey Weinstein's you basically said we did I his woman designs clothes for women to wear and she's dead is it may be our fault is it may be the women's Walter these women dressing too sensuous lead to sexually here's how it sounded I think we have to look at ourselves hunter we display our self how do we present ourselves as are we asking for it you know by presenting all the sensuality and all the sexuality you know what what we trying out to our children today holy cliche Batman for crying out loud do you realize how this sets back the movement of the feminazis this is the kind of thing that in the early days of this that men would offer as a defense eight look at the way they are presenting themselves to me there come in here there's scantily clad because they're showing off things they're walking selectively they want it member guys would say that remember how they were raked over the coals being insensitive your disrespectful here comes Donna Karen who is the generation of strikes and so she be white but not five now and she's echoing these sentiments women don't women blame the victim I'm surprised it took hours for her to walk this back but it did are not the ear is are the same web another sound bite here are from the same event she was at this fashion film awards if van den or whatever it was she continued so I don't think it's only Harvey Weinstein I don't think we're only looking at him I think we're looking at a world much deeper than that he's we looked out to you now you know as a symbol not necessarily is I know his wife I think they're wonderful people %HESITATION argues guns an amazing thing I think we have to look at our world of what we want to say and how we want to say it is well it's not our rewind see you look at everything all over the world today you know and how women are dressing and you know what they're asking by just presenting themselves the way they do asking for trouble they're wearing her clothes she designs a because of these waves where she now says they're asking for trouble they're presenting themselves the way they do and that's asking for trouble this is before she walked it back you talk about tone deaf you talk about being not connected till present this is just I read this last night as it does somebody have to be amplifying this a little bit nobody could be this Britain on the left I mean Donna Karen is as loyal a leftist as you will find anywhere you can't explain much about but she's there and she believes that she doesn't know why she's one of those just nothing to be I given the business and industries that that that she is in our but this kind of boggles the mind so now she's walked it back after the predictable up work and is claiming that she was taken out of the US was taken out of context out there %HESITATION well I I did so it's hard to know %HESITATION what the right context there would be a but I mean the UK Daily Mail I was all over this Donna Karen comes to Harvey Weinstein's defense suggesting is victims may be asking for it OB and this caused all kinds a reaction from noted Hollywood actresses like rose McGowan %HESITATION that now it cloning has weighed in it it's bad but you know I've known Harvey all these years and I didn't I didn't I never knew any of those go I've no idea I don't allow that her look what I didn't know any of this was going on down there was talk about I didn't know any of this nobody who knew Harvey gnarly I mean Harvey never go out today that I've never heard a thing about it was isn't that incredible the lengths to which people are are going Donna Brazile you know I I said the other day the Democrats do not know how to innovate that they've got a play book that tells them what to say when to say it about any issue that comes up it does and it's not relevant to current present time it's just a standard cliche response Hillary is famous for them well Donna Brazile a former Democrat National Committee chairwoman Donna Brazile deleted a tweet praising the Weinstein company for taking the lead against sexual assault after they fired a heartbeat so this is exactly what I mean Harvey Weinstein admits the pairing off only admits to mistreating have a theme as the admitted to the eight payoffs but there did they eight women paid off non new Yorkers alleging three women say he raped them it's getting worse and in the midst of this they fire Harvey and the announcer gonna change enable the Weinstein company the popsicle company or whatever it is and Donna Brazile won't that's the right thing that's a great they cheat so she tweets out ray is from the Weinstein company taking the lead against sexual assault after they fired one sting this is a classic perfunctory formulaic response that's in the Democrat playbook that is tone deaf and is on the aware of present activity things how in the world do you pray is the winds steam company for taking the lead in that sexual assault what she thinks she is doing is being loyal to a donor well the Weinstein company wasn't the donor Harvey was she thinks that she's been loyal to a donor she thinks she's crawling proper respect to a donor and it's entirely tone deaf because all she did she pried doesn't need the playbook because in in many pages she probably wrote it so event happens programmed responses called for and she others it without any awareness of how hypocritical ironic or tone deaf that it is the wind speed and this week was yesterday our Sunday this is Tuesday this tweet was Sunday the Weinstein company has taken a lead against sexual harassment and assault they got rid of Harvey the Donna Brazile is so used to doing PR for Democrats so used to formulate it Billy defending them she just naturally tried to spin the story from the Weinstein company because they're good Democrat loyal donors but this is just tone deafness Hillary's tweet back in November two thousand fifteen when she tweeted at the bar right sexual assaults on campus hysteria every survivor of sexual assault deserves to be heard believed and supported this is from the woman who ran the bimbo eruptions unit in the Clinton White House whose purpose was to destroy any women that came forth and alleged that Bill Clinton had done anything to them and that's not you may be saying anything I if you are it's a good question rush big deal so they're formulaic sold the reason I mention that it's not just the talk it's part and parcel of my belief that these people are right for being defeated fox remember it's all about that as far as I'm for these people have to be defeated in the arena of ideas and at the ballot box and in the culture they have to be defeated and so if there is this inept if they're this formulaic and out of touch to me it makes them easier targets there's no reason to be afraid of them there's no reason to fear them even though the media's on their site this is my point in pointing this out the fact that it's a formulaic response and his tone deaf and maybe even be hypocritical means nothing in and of itself other than these people are not as brilliant as everybody thinks but the real point about it is they aren't innovating they are not living in twenty three twenty seventeen with their but their policies their issues their agenda they are right for defeat is my point and this is something that should instill confidence in the people fighting them that they're not so many people believe unbeatable that they are not formidable they're actually antiques and they are ripe for being defeated in the arena of ideas let me take a break I will come back and continue much more is always after mmhm or yeah yeah yeah we're going to get to the NFL in Jamelle hill a genuine radical and the ESPN and the trunk stir in fact I have a good that I'm gonna fall all that into one you know what what trump is actually doing here in this story that the generals in the intelligence departments agencies and taken over running the country and are in open defiance of trump those stories are from people that you would have thought are conservative by virtue of their names in their in their past but they have become so Abdel with anger and rage like what's really driving a lot of the so called conservatives is that their influence has been demonstrated to be nil I devoted their magazine and was in there commentary to defeating trump and it didn't happen and so now they're just angry and and and throwing what a burp against the wall seeping in stick %HESITATION but it is nevertheless serious charge that trump is being openly defied by the swamp members of the swamp and his administration is widely fire on that that's happening I have a theory that I will sparrows as the program unfold the to wrap up this wine Steve stuff the daily beast reporting today that the New York P. D. was ready to arm rest Harvey Weinstein a woman went to the special victims unit after an encounter with wine stain and they wanted her to wear a wire and go back to a meeting which she had told Harvey she would not meet him the next day they wanted her to go back with the wire and get him on tape admitting what he had done the day before and then doing whatever he did the woman's name was Ambra %HESITATION that's a lot she excused herself to use the restroom met by detective from S. B. your which I'd been using to cell phones to record a meeting in March of two thousand fifteen by the time it was all over the New York police department so they didn't have not enough to charge a felony but they were ready to that's how many complaints they have been receiving and as a result they were watching Weinstein I don't know to what extent he was under surveillance but he was that he was on the radar not all that means isn't this pretty serious stuff now this is this is not an instantly gone beyond the realm here of Hollywood gossip and gotcha you know something else that that I thought of %HESITATION when all this was happening and if this was an original thought that high of cents abandoned as an explanation but you know setups like this happen all the time %HESITATION there are law firms and there are people who try to set up people and get them to behave in embarrassing slash illegal slash ha ha compromising positions all for the purposes of blackmailing him pursuing them %HESITATION and when I first heard as Hollywood return in Hollywood where cut throat competition impersonal envy and rivalries are off the charts absence rejected that that's a factor here but it does happen blue greetings along about your Guiding Light Rush Limbaugh make cutting edge OB societal evolution having more fun than a human being should be allowed to there have Harvey Weinstein's name is to be removed from all the TV shows he produced Weinstein company also wants to change its name in addition to taking Harvey's name off it anything they've ever produced TV movies whatever %HESITATION the name Harvey Weinstein being purged from Hollywood on Monday deadline reported the winds steam company is removing the Harveys producer credit from any TV series is work on the plant's stole my point wipe it from upcoming movie releases and also report that job the Weinstein company's auditioning and agencies to change its company name or to get that's a Soviet style you know the way you get rid of probably just change the name also what else well I don't think Harvey could even survive airbrushing I mean that is one ugly could could put him you know something you something else about this I was reading my tech blogs and even apple apple is trying to get the end on the we hate Harvey now bandwagon apparently there's some Elvis Presley by all appeared first on such thing that you can rent or buy on iTunes and apple made a big deal out of saying it's not available we've pulled it you can't buy it you can't read it because that pig Harvey Weinstein hands on me they didn't say pick but I mean that's that is what is implied we also have Mrs Clinton ladies and gentleman not only did she wheat that all the women claiming abuse have the right to be believed she senso this is job campaign website YouTube channel September fourteenth two thousand fifteen that he's part of a new ad that Hillary had released Hillary's message to survivors of sexual I'm not I'm not not not no I'm not laughing at the prim I'm laughing at the title Hillary Clinton's message just survivors of the irony here her husband was the predator in chief and she was the woman that ran the unit in the White House whose objective was to destroy the lives and reputations of any women who might come forward to accuse her husband of having abused them or been in a relationship such as an affair with them it with Hillary and Betsy Wright when the bimbo eruptions unit so the irony here is why I'm laughing and and this this is from that and Hillary's message to survivors of sexual assault I want to send a message to every survivor of sexual assault don't let anyone silence your voice you have a right to be heard and you have a right to be believed were with you know she is not she hasn't said a word about Harvey and you know here's another thing all of these Democrat groups and some candidates have announced very righteously there they are re circulating Harvey's donations they are not keeping the money they are getting rid of it no money is just follow the money from Harvey is tainted then they want nothing to do with it I'm not sure I believe it like the DMCA is taking ten percent of what Harvey donated and sending it to people like Planned Parenthood they're just re distributing it to other Democrat groups but you know we never see and this kind of this dovetails into a point that I'm gonna be making about trump here just second we never see what these people actually do they make a big deal out of claiming that they're wiping their hands of the Harvey money and they're gonna get rid of it now they're not giving it back they're honest about that they say they're gonna redirected to redistribute it but we never see that we never see the track or the wire transfer or what ever mechanism is you is to take that money out of their account and move it to somebody else's we never see that the drive bys never demand it these people just get away with saying they're going to do it and we never know if they actually do and this by the way is the salient point coming up the weight trump will not let go of this and about thing normally in the old days of your something like this would happen a powerful Republican would offer a bit of criticism of some institution and that would be it the institution would react in mock outrage and make fun out of or attack the Republican accuser it would be awful trump is not letting it hadn't trump is not stopping until the NFL Bannister was well I'll tell you something Jerry Jones the owner of the Dallas Cowboys sorry goddess the owner of the Dallas got boys it's a way of saying how about them cowboys CAP a B. O. ideas how bout them kept noise Jerry Jones owns it Dennis got boys and Jerry Jones said you either stand for the anthem or you don't fly your standard you're benched while the drive bys today sports drive bys are all asking what is the NFL gonna do to Jerry Jones how is the NFL gonna punish Jerry Jones Jerry Jones can't do that is the inference when you read this what is the league going to do to Jerry Jones Jerry Jones and the other owners are the lead number one number two what's gonna happen I've got a little headline link that I just saw here on the drudge report NFL owners consider rules change requiring players the standard sounds like what the league is going to do is moving in the direction of Jerry Jones but the sports drive bys and are they hope when the league comes down hard old Jerry Jerry can't do this Jerry can require his employees to do this and that is the whole point these players are talking about their platform it isn't there's how many times my friends have I spoken of the field of play in professional sports is the equivalent of the stage it is it's the stage the bait and I'll tell you when I first made this reference I'll never forget it dusty Baker was the manager I think of the San Francisco Giants admit that may be given there I'm not sure ever managed the giants at any rate it was a playoff game and I think it was dusty Baker wanted but one of them that managers kit right five or six years old was in the dark out watching the game and somehow ended up I think was playing bat boy the owners can was wearing uniform playing bat boy very very young single digit ages and the kid ended up dangerously close to home plate where there was going to be a collision a runner was trying to score and one of the I think giants players had to scoop up the kid to get him out of the way in the middle of the gate and I remember saying you don't let people on the stage that don't belong there you don't let non performers on the stage the NFL field if the stage stage is owned by the owners it is their platform it's their stage they are the ones that invest and pay for every aspect each week's games now I know that there are deals with cities and state governments on the tax favorability for building the stadium I'm not trying to get in the weeds here my point is the players don't own any of they are employees like you and me and any employee taking time out from the job to protest American the flag or whatever if you went in the McDonald's you wanted it happy meal and you had to sit there and listen to the clerk or the checkout person preach to you about police brutality in all what would you do and would you expect the media to come in and and and and support the so called right of free speech for McDonald's employees to do this while you await your happy meal put yourself in any business and have the same thing happened and ask if you would be expected to sit there and put up with it and shut up and not disagree with it understand they have a right they have a platform there protesting the evils of America and you have to listen to it what you're doing and walk out of the place you wouldn't put up with it you tell other people what happened nobody else would show up which is exactly what's happening in the NFL last night's ratings Monday Night Football yeah I'm that tank according to what I just saw not a record low but why a white down fact it was a dull game you know I didn't watch but I take what I did well I was working I'm always working but it's not work so but I mean to define the activity I'm working I'm reading and preparing I'm remembering I'm logging I'm injecting my memory with things that I expect to be there on immediate recall and I decided to check the game had the TV on I was watching some shows I'd recorded last week having a chance to see I tune in and the score of the game near the end of the first half was three even to and I said this is gonna be the biggest bomb of an NFL Monday night game and read three to two that means a field goal and a safety from maybe it was to to to I don't know but it was and then the next time I checked it was seventeen seventeen white in the fourth quarter look like they might be heading to over time but that but that didn't happen and I was telling myself this is this is not good and then I noticed something in all of their you know look at video highlights and I'm noticing I'm not seeing any more shots of the upper decks at NFL stadiums my should the myself why am I not seeing it wide shots that that that show the full stadium dynamics it's because there's some empty seats up there probably and they broadcast networks obviously their partners are they gonna Felder doing what they can to their starting to televise the national anthem laughs but wait I thought the players had a platform the players could demand no none of the players don't all that the owners this is why so many people led by me been asking one of the owners of the they got they got a choice here I got one of two choices and they're choosing to go with the side it's actually hurting them the way they look at it either choice they make is going to hurt them Joe Namath was on fox wasn't this morning yeah Joe name of Joe Willie and they played a sound bite of me Aug claiming not claiming a claim and I said that I don't think the NFL knows it's what if they're gonna fell like so many like the Democrats they lead their own polls and believe them %HESITATION is C. E. O.'s and marketing people advertising people watch the media and they really think the country's gone left of center culturally imagining the audience as and they're dead wrong about who the audience is and that's why they side with the players I think the players are actually exhibiting behavior that reflects a majority of thinking in the country but words that people run the NFL probably do believe that most country most of the countries livid at the cops because if that's if if they watch any knows other than fox if they really there and New York times Washington post you know they do that's the picture of American they get every day and is in curious is people on the left are they may believe it that's why I think that they really misunderstand her audiences despite their expertise in marketing and all that but you can tell the audience is by looking at the most frequently advertise products and it's not the wind in Bree crowd well anyway name is made the point that they are Afro Americans that's what al Davis that that's cultural to that one time they were Afro Americans and became African Americans in black and I went back and forth but there was a certain era in America's recent past when it sure was Afro America al Davis called me one day in the nineties after having late night just after seeing me talk about tax cuts with Paula Zahn one five X. knows he called me to tell me how his Afro American players don't understand their position that they're part of the wealthy that are being targeted but they don't think they are because of your life anyway and I don't think I will not lose my great point they're coming anyway I was gonna say we don't name it was saying that he really relates to the the cause of the of the Afro Americans %HESITATION and their belief that the police %HESITATION mistreat them and so forth but then he won I made the point that he doesn't understand the owners inevitably the ease of the owners our own they stage here Graham audio summit number eighteen was Steve Doocy Brian Kilmeade talking to him %HESITATION and there are the seeds well that's the second bite but this is there's four days I only need one limited and they have been hidden in general there are yeah we need number seventeen do you think this is crisis time for the NFL audio summit seventeen here it is I'm not sure it's a crisis time I don't think the sports ever going to go away but gone back to what Colin Kaepernick initially did it was to point out some in just that that's being done to the black race or to people %HESITATION that obviously when you look at next they obviously some of these dash cams and shootings that were done to unarmed people in all he was reaching out to try and get it more investigated so that's what if oppression thing comes in yeah wasn't trying that but I give Joe a pass in Mr understanding what Kaepernick was up to the biggest Joe I know what Joe was doing here and I don't blame him he's royalty among NFL he's not gonna start causing fight but this is what he said about the owner I don't understand the NFL owners I mean here we're working to somebody walks across here with a sign right now protesting excuse me you're going to let him do that no well initially when this took place that's the NFL ownership they own that theater at the time they own that stage you going all out protest out there they don't allow players to wear different signs on their shoes they know that has his Stanford ash I you know what the %HESITATION that's because they've been told to but no one told Rollin cabinet prior to that that they had to we just assumed it was the right thing to do it's always been the right thing to do to have in this country thank the Littler Joe is really want it both ways here goes out of the way it to establish understanding and support for key predicament pulls it back my claim it why do you owners let him know what which really is question when you get right down to it by the way I love all these foreign to okay go back to the Orioles graveyard here and at least in the modern era probably can't claim original credit somebody's obviously said that but he's right here nobody told Kaepernick you can't do it until he's done that a number of times anyway that's what's coming sol hang on to the right past three hours immediately if you're on the phone please be patient every effort will be met to get to your call today and as quickly |||||||||| welcome to today's edition of bulrush twenty four seven podcast performs how are you have a good weekend everybody raring and ready to go three hours broadcast excellence starting right now right here EIB network and your Guiding Light and America's real anchorman the Rush Limbaugh fictionally known as the all knowing all carrying all sensing all feeling Mahar Rushey here at eight hundred two eight two two eight eight to the email address I'll rush well err yeah I believe that dot you asks had dozens I thought there was no such thing as downtime this past weekend it was as busy as any day during the week and let's just get started here is sort of an outline of where we're going today course the Harvey Weinstein situation folks this is big it's not just about a Hollywood mogul and here's %HESITATION misbehavior as is always the case it's a teachable moment it is filled with life lessons for people about liberalism and I'm gonna tell you where all of this really began it all began in nineteen sixty nine at Chappaquiddick when Ted Kennedy was allowed to get away with manslaughter at all costs now in nineteen sixty nine modern era feminism was G. office being on rolled and at the time this happened it really wasn't established yet up it had some high schoolgirls excited and all the Twitter but that was about it the real mad dash to the militant era of feminism didn't really get going until nineteen seventy but the Democrat party the Kennedy family going out of their way at all costs to defend senator Kennedy set the stage for the Democrat party's glaring hypocrisy and then we move forward to Bill Clinton in the second term of his presidency with the Monica Lewinsky episode and once again after the full era of militant feminism in the modern era have become in trench into our society the Democrat party defending Bill Clinton at all costs land by his wife Hillary Rodham Clinton is what gave us the ongoing behavior on major prominent Democrats up to and including Harvey Weinstein Ted Kennedy you might say made it all possible Bill Clinton came along and put an exclamation point behind Ted Kennedy and now even with Harvey Weinstein look at what he thinks he has to do to save himself come out as an even more strident leftist promise to take out Wayne lapierre promised to take out trump in Dow five million dollars worth of charity work for women's issues and so forth and it's that simple to buy off the left in this case however time will tell if that will be successful Weinstein's now been fired from the country he co founded a company co founded %HESITATION but the details of the story enemy elements of it as it continues to unfold are once again a gigantic teachable moment you know what else they are they're a giant see I told you so twenty five thirty years I'm see I told you so but I'm telling you folks do not discount this the Democratic Party and the media going out of its way at all hawk to defend Bill Clinton sends a signal to every other Democrat heavyweight predator it sent a signal to virtually every powerful individual on the left that they were not going to be held to account that excuse is would be made and tolerances would be expanded if they remained devoted to the cause or causes now Harvey Weinstein situation look at what buddy several however but he knew everybody knew for all these years we've now learned that the New York times have a story ready to go in two thousand four by Sharon Waxman that was gonna detail all of this up to two thousand for the New York times' killed it the New York times' killed it and they're getting kinda cream here by Sharon Waxman no longer writing there who says you know it's kind of funny this low New York times Mar allies about how the media look the other way all these years with Harvey Weinstein when they led the league in looking the other way and spiking stories about wine stain Saturday Night Live did not talk about wine steam they didn't make any jokes about wine stain they didn't do a thing about wines to him and you know what Lorne Michaels and the producer Saturday night well it's a New York thing Harvey is a New Yorker you know we give our own people up but he didn't say that's what he meant we give our own people a Pat well here's another there's it trump is a New Yorker but that's what blows the whole story to smithereens his whole mind reasoning OB there is another series of comparisons being made between trump and Harvey Weinstein and another flailing attempt by the left to neutralize the impact what one sees not let me tell you there's a couple stories a stack about this trump hasn't done diddly squat compared Harvey Weinstein trump is no where near Harvey Weinstein's lake trump hasn't done anything remotely close to what Harvey Weinstein knowingly did and which for which he was excused for all of these years somebody did a survey of a number of years of Oscar ceremony broadcasts and they found out that there are over a long period of time I forget the number beer's bottling it least ten maybe fourteen years in examining acceptance speeches of Oscar winners Harvey Weinstein was thank more than god maybe it wasn't it was it was it was a thought he was a pig he was powerful he was a bully and everybody was afraid of him and was sucking up to women that everything they could to try to make sure hardly never got mad at them but all that time people were sealed thing that he was getting away with it nobody had the guts to come out and say a couple of women did but they were ignored so now the comparisons are on between tromping Harvey Weinstein and there aren't any comparisons to Donald Trump and Harvey Weinstein and yes they both are new Yorkers and Saturday Night Live is routinely engaged in trying to destroy Donald Trump now we move on to Indianapolis and Mike pence at the forty niner cold game yesterday ladies and gentlemen this is what pushing back looks like get used to this this is what pushing back looks like this is what the left not getting away with setting the narrative and determining who can and who can't say anything this is what it looks like this is what it looks like when you push back against that you may find it uncomfortable you may think you may buy into this no Jew who is the vice president I'm going in there and hard drug the Peten manning stood to one thing Mike pence didn't hijack anything players in the National Football League of hijack that business and what they are doing is causing bad business great damage the players there's no first amendment right here keep reading media people very good term credible poor just don't put your privilege under first amendment right there they've there's no first amendment relevant here in addition to that you are not free from consequences of exercising their first amendment rights if you want to say what you want to say and be what we want to be with there are consequences and you're not immune to those and Furthermore nobody has to listen to what you say and nobody has to watch what you do so when you force your speech or behavior on people who don't whatever you do with it you don't get the moral high ground not anymore if you do that you're going to have people walk out of the stadium you're gonna have people turn the games off you're going to have fans not show up you're gonna have serious ratings problems you're going to have great great damage done to that business and that is exactly what is happening here now the very same maybe the very same reporters and pundits who are praising players for kneeling and expressing their free speech viewers are now blasting vice president pens for walking out of the cold sport or game and for expressing his free speech they're claiming that what he did was up P. artist not there claiming that he and trump cooked up they're claiming that they knew these players were gonna Neil and so they planned to go in there and sit there until the players Neil and intense walks out the proof for this is that supposedly the pants media detail was told not to bother coming into the stadium stay on the bus it pants was are gonna be there very long it's not my tent pens that made this possible it's the players for the San Francisco forty Niners and if any of the calls were involved who made this possible this is what pushing back looks like folks this is what refusing to see the moral high ground to the left looks like and of course they're going to act like stuck pigs they're gonna react like they've been offended like no one ever has how dare you take my PR stunt and converted into your PR stunt how dare you and they're coming down on pants and they're coming down on trump but pens and trump are simply being consistent with what they have said from the get go on all of this they are not pants has %HESITATION isn't it children's song in not in Iraq %HESITATION don't forget this either it was about a year ago Mike pence and his wife went to a performance of Hamilton on Broadway and you remember this and during that performance cast members decided to like Mike pence vice president elect on the importance of protecting diversity pants just smiled and he was polite and he took it he went to enjoy the performance he wanted to go backstage congratulate the cast on a job well done but they mock Damon made fun of him and then the lecture to him while he's in the audience on the importance of diversity well pencil Trumper not taking it anymore and this is what it looks like for decades now we have become conditioned to just accept any and all anti American displays were supposed to be tolerant we're supposed to sit back when they try to put out of business a bakery or a photography shop that refuses to cater because of religious freedom in the constitution a gay wedding those businesses are sought to they are targeted and they are sued the people that run them how targeted for being put out of business and we sit around and we just accept it but we're not sitting around and were not accepting it anymore we're supposed to be tolerant they tell us so I give trump and pants credit for at least pushing back and trying to do programa so little that we don't have to take it and I don't care if the media gets all upset and exercise vice president wasted taxpayer money you want to talk about wasting taxpayer money now but it's still eat expenditure of money on a nonexistent fact collusion between trump and Russia to rig the election summing it did not happen something for which there is no evidence and how much money have spent so far and how much of it has been wasted we never talked about all of them well they didn't we did all the money you talk to provide vacations and separate airplanes for the Obamas and Mrs Obama taking your own plane when she wanted to leave a day early the Obamas set a record for the amount of tax payer dollars spent on vacations and we were told to just sit there and take it the president was important in there is down time recharge the batteries George W. bush chopping wood in Texas was never said to need down time to read charges batteries they accused him of not caring about the job the people of the country and going down to Crawford Texas and wasting time because he was too stupid to know what was right and wrong anyway there's about wasting money when we had the national debt doubled under seven years eight years of Barack Obama this is what pushed back looks like ladies and gentlemen when Mike pence walks out as a protest he is engaged in an unprincipled PR stunt they say but when players kneeled to protest why that is printable behavior that you are not permitted to question and you are not permitted to disagree with any you are not permitted to comment every day Americans get what's going on here when hypocrisy is in the news such as gun confiscation demands by those with bodyguards for example yeah my friends always Hollywood biggies in all these these are politicians are demanding the confiscation of guns even though by the way I asked the question last week senator Schumer can you name me a law that would have stopped the shooter in Las Vegas and Dianne Feinstein has answered and she's admitted there's not a law how long is she Ferguson he's out there saying you're right you're right there isn't a law we could pass that would have prevented this thank you senator Feinstein and these people demanding confiscation of guns require that their security details be armed they're different than you they're better they are more important they need armed guards you don't need your god this is one of the reasons one of the many why trump wins he wins because he's transparent he's the voice of the people to make the country work not the voice of the people who claim to do the country's thinking and I don't mean this exclusively with matters of policy trump speaks on behalf of people who have been insulted and bullied and deceived these NFL protester not about policy this is a cultural issue this is about damaging the National Football League this is about inflicting as much harm on the M. F. L. as possible and is wildly succeeding millions of people pledge their allegiance to the constitution the flag which represents that we just that allegiance supersedes allegiance to any NFL team or any because there is a strong and binding culture that exists among people who don't live in an elitist bubbles Donald Trump sides with the people because he thinks they're right there in any hidden agenda here no double standards it's just simply about right or wrong it's the practical expression of patriotism and it's being assaulted it is being MP on it is being protest and it goes against the grain of the thinking of the vast majority of the American people and finally people are pushing back against this and the people who are engaged these protests are acting so righteously offended and indignant that they're not being listened to that they're not being heard what they're asking is not being replied to nobody has to listen to your players you don't get that right nobody has to agree with you and Furthermore you do not get a pass on consequences when you engage your free speech rights whatever else you think you happen to be doing welcome back folks just getting warmed up just getting started here at the EIB network president troubles unveiled a new list direct seventy point immigration enforcement plan it to our calls for comprehensive a comprehensive rewrite I'm laws to use different men border security and the interior and specifically to kat chain migration and trump has pitched it did a Democrat to Chuck emancipate you guys wanna help me out with this immigration bill the Democrats are ruling it out the Democrats say that trumps request for border wall funding and help for the dreamers which is another truck proposal I will not fly you're not gonna get any money from the wall for a month I don't care what you're trying to bribe us with say Chuck and Nancy so immigration firing on all cylinders %HESITATION and senator Bob Corker %HESITATION Tennessee a retiring from the Senate has finally once and for all obviously opened up about the Republican establishment view of Donald Trump and what they think their role ears which basically to nullify try to contain trump to main ten are precious current world order trump poses the greatest threat Republicans in the Senate think it's their job to thwart the proper gender Corker said so in frustration we'll be back I books welcome back your phone calls will be part of the program as well eight hundred two eight two two eight eight zero and again what we're loaded today I'm gonna do everything I can to get everything I want to talk about am and there is a lot of it I can't do a fourth hour today because I have a newsletter interview after the program today this instantly we're thinking about doing what I was and I realize I have a newsletter and it well I mean I'm I'm thinking about it because I just got more stuff and I get to hear look the Harvey Weinstein thing up fox this is not about hypocrisy the left never is held accountable on their hypocrisy anyway no matter how blatant and this is his blatant example our case of hypocrisy as you can get my trident compare now trump to Weinstein is a big difference here Donald Trump talked Donald Trump talked the talk with some host an NBC coming out of a trailer and interestingly trump was talking about what celebrities like winds need to get away with simply because their celebrities but trump there's no record of trouble doing any of this I trump can't hold a candle to whine steam in this regard winds then walk the walk while trump was doing was talking about the very kind of behavior that is permitted when celebrities are involved but hypocrisy is not I mean there's plenty of it but that's not what this is about what this is about is plain and simple the abuse of women the mistreatment of women that was ignored and tolerated and in some quarters laughed at and applauded Hey man great work if you can get any Harvey way that goal but Hey Harvey ways to get away with this RV have his supporters Harvey had lots of women in Hollywood who owed him a lot they believed in they got silent and they stayed site although Meryl Streep have you heard about this Mr snidely Meryl Streep one of those who has called Harvey Weinstein gone yes now slammed wines things disgraceful behavior it's finally spoken out I have it right here my formerly to get used lengthy statement released early today the disgraceful news about Harvey Weinstein him has appalled those of us whose work you champion than those who is good and worthy causes he supported it's not the new is that's disgraceful ms Streep it's wine stain you know the wording of this the disgraceful news about her it none of it the disgraceful Harvey Weinstein not the new business street she said the intrepid women who raise their voices to expose this abuse are our heroes you ignored that she goes on to claim she didn't know she did know about this till she first read the huffing and puffing didn't post and then she made a point of saying I want to correct something not everybody knew because that was the news on Friday that everybody knew she says no not everybody knew well %HESITATION we'll give her that if that's what she wants to say but it's awfully hard to believe but **** this isn't about Epocrates this is about the ongoing abuse serial abuse all of women by a prominent Democrat party fundraiser bumbler and donor and very very powerful person within the Democrat party and they knew and they willingly look the other way they will willingly went after everybody else that they thought had anything like this going on their lives you name the name's bill o'reilly Roger ailes you name it and these people cannot hold a candle to Harvey Weinstein and you look at the efforts to destroy them compared to the democratic party's overwhelming and Hollywood's overwhelming talent all of ignoring Harvey Weinstein and propping it up but I'm telling you it all began with teddy Kennedy and then it really crystallize with Bill Clinton because when the party and the media spent every bit a capital they had went to every length possible to defend and maintain Bill Clinton in office what's the message that was sent I'll tell your folks here is that the thing to learn about this the left doesn't care about people the left cares about power they don't care about people and yet they own the image of being the only people do care about people it's the left that owns this moniker home compassion and only that have compassion conservatives Republicans are cold hearted means bearded racist sexist bigot homophobe and the people on the left are princes and they respect and they hoist women up and they sponsor women's causes and they defend women at all costs accounts the over reaching behavior of so called conservative predators when in fact predation is heaviest and most intense on the left that's why the left stayed silent and even lied for Ted Kennedy it's why Democrats stayed silent and or lied for Bill Clinton it's why the left mobilized to hide the decline that's why Democrats would let anyone see the affordable Care Act before it was crammed down our throats when they wouldn't let anybody see that's why the left stays silent or lies about baby Borchers at Planned Parenthood they care more about power then people with the left fox it's never about people look at the people they claim the champion look at the groups look of the victims they claim to be protecting looking out for ask yourself how is life for people in those groups those groups are routinely angry are they not they're routinely angry and unhappy and discontent and they're constantly looking for the Democrat party to make it better and how does a Democrat party make it better by promising to get even with the people who are responsible for the plight of all the people investing everything in the Democrat party for fifty years African Americans in this country been complaining and whining about you name it and the Democrat party has been promising for fifty years to fix it and get even with the people perpetrating all these evils and nothing changes the same complaints the same misery the same on happen is for fifty years developed for what Gino's amiss panics and what would you say about women now who are investing in the Democrat party thinking it's the Democrat party that looks out for them the Democrat party that's going to protect to protect them from these evil conservative Republicans who are out there just waiting to mistreat them and be misogynist and racist and sexist and male chauvinist pigs your ears the Democrat party ever momentarily sorry when they get caught for a few days like Bill Clinton told what it abruptly put some ice on it split lip after her encounter with him so no folks they don't care about people they care about power Harvey Weinstein is on me intentional war on hypocrisy Harvey Weinstein is a metaphor for the entire Democratic Party over the past few decades like a lot of people have become numb to the left numerous Astoria Bacchus is because they're never held accountable epoxy never sticks to the left it's like they have teflon against but every now and then something happens to illuminate the real message of the Democrat party in the American left Harvey Weinstein's implosion is a light shining brightly on just who and just what the American left is to preserve Hollywood's casting couch in other vehicles for Democrats serial sexual harassments or worse liberals hijacked feminism to service cover and I really believe this I think the Democrat party and liberals hijacked feminism as cover for their own behavior and it worked like a champ ask Bill Clinton it worked like a champ ask Harvey Weinstein until something happened and he lost his power in Hollywood which is probably due to losing money which by the way I pointed out last week now everybody over the weekend hijack that comment no credit to me of course and they're being praised as brilliant and figured out why now even though you knew about it before all of them waved it but let's just look from Ted Kennedy to Bill Clinton to Woody Allen Bill Cosby to Harvey Weinstein Anthony Weiner to Eliot Spitzer and they all exploited women without consequence because they were card carrying members of the liberal establishment which includes the media and Hollywood and Washington not only are prominent Democrats guilty of egregious hypocrisy when it comes to feminism there equally guilty when it comes to environmentalism leftists to announce carbon footprints they denounce the over abundant you wish of CO two they routinely shame people for their lifestyles and yet produce volcano sized carbon footprints them selves I'm practically every seminal issue the Democrats mandate to left mandates a certain behavior for everybody but themselves they are always exempted from the punitive policies that they want imposed on everybody else they claim the sea levels are rising there apoplectic in public crying about rising oceans they shrewdly by up beach front property when the cameras aren't looking they live in the very places they claim are going to be under water in a number of years they know all of the sky isn't falling and they know the oceans aren't rising liberalism is a con game they have no intention using the same healthcare system they devised everybody else they do everything they can to make sure no law affects them affordable healthcare is the kind of stuff they give us it's neither health care no more affordable it's a sop to their donors and it turns out they're bullies sexual bullies in the workplace equal pay our them equal pay for women equal pay here equal treatment there look at the way they treat women in Hollywood it will pave the Obama White House that was a joke it will play at the Clinton crime family foundation we find out that there is no equality in any of these institutions that the left Ron there's no equality and there's no safety look at Chicago looking to try to look at the places they run it's a giant con game that liberalism has going Harvey Weinstein now becomes a metaphor it's Ted Kennedy is Leonardo the cabbies bill and Hillary Clinton's bill Cosby's the Obama's is Eliot Spitzer anyway that's that but there are other interesting details in the story which will get to but we'll move on to other things when we get back folks because we got to get it all in your hang on greetings welcome back Rush Limbaugh here the excellence in broadcasting network Jerry Jones the owner of the Dallas Cowboys said that any player who disrespects the flag will not play for the Dallas Cowboys snidely your cowboys fan you agree with that if you do Steve Ross who owns the Miami Dolphins said if you come out you are standing nobody is kneeling three players studied in the locker room during the national anthem now why would Jerry Jones the owner of the Dallas Cowboys said that any player who disrespects the flag will not play for the cowboys I have a theory I think Jerry Jones wants to save his business you know I'm nobody's looking the NFL is in a world of hurt they are no longer according to polling data the country's national pastime they're no longer the country's most favorite sport but not even in second place now this has been a monumental decline and it began before the current player protest began it began with the sports drive bys focusing on concussions and making a movie about it and %HESITATION changing the way people watch the game people watch the NFL now almost in fear that somebody's gonna got die get killed somebody's going to get so severely ma'am they watch this and they're nervous watching the game and some people are thinking you know maybe they should now you add these protests of the country on top of it and it's more than the NFL can withstand all the players union has been found to have been donating the liberal causes and liberal activist groups have been found to be supporting the Players Association George Soros and others unbeknownst to anybody the players union has been supporting big time leftist causes that's not coming out that's not gonna fly because that's not what people think and want when it comes to professional sports and players and players union officials are now saying we're not but that thing the planks were not brought does the country yes you are I don't care what you think you're doing then what are you doing how many of you players know exactly why you're kneeling anyway is it because you want to remain loyal to Kaepernick or you think being %HESITATION sand bag here by the league well if you're in unison with Kaepernick you gotta go back and listen what Kaepernick said was the reason he's doing all this and he's doing it precisely because of the inequality and the bias and the discrimination in this country and the fact that the cops kill people of color and get away with it out if you are in solidarity with Kaepernick and that's what you're doing you can't say you're not protesting the flag when you take a need during the anthem you can't say you're not protesting the anthem that's exactly what you're seeing is doing why else do it but what you're really do what what these players are really doing is attacking the very business that has not mistreated them the very business that has made them wealthy and gives them a opportunity like they would not have anywhere else and they are summarily attacking and damaging that business and Jerry Jones isn't gonna put up with it he's going to do what he can to save his business now a lot of these players are mad at trump they think trump is attacked them I think trumps attack their rights but that's not what is going on Donald Trump is not the problem Donald Trump actually was that the head of the line trying to warn me an NFL that its business is in trouble if they don't get their arms around this and stop it I know why I don't know who else who said this but I want to go on record right now say Harvey Weinstein's career is not over all know that they'll find a way to bring him back in the fall you watch Brian Williams still on the air it can be seen as a not I %HESITATION doesn't matter doesn't matter mark my words you see |||||||||| welcome to today's edition of bulrush twenty four seven plug dressed well I don't know where the guys registered to vote now but I just came across them is that once you make your shooter Stephen panic on April eleventh nineteen eighty four registered to vote in Boca Raton as a Democrat the shorter registered as a Democrat I don't know where is registered now I've walks ready to wrap up our busy broadcast week today most southern it's all good luck home and I look forward to it every day won't and you would not believe the number people say you need to do a fourth and a half hour more often some people saying you need to do that not TV don't afford to have or you don't need a TV that is TV do that the pressure is mounting ladies and gentleman the consensus is that all I am not doing a mouse not just kidding about that greetings open line Friday eight hundred two eight two two eight eight till if you want to be on the program to email address L. rush ball at EIB nat dot com is your question do you think a major conservative Republican fat cat donor would have been able to keep secret eight different sexual harassment settlements you think they would have been able to keep that out of the media for decades just just remember what all has happened at fox news in recent years and compare that to what's happening here with that with Harvey Weinstein a VOB whine steam pictures and prior to that Miramax it it really hit it it's astounding to look at the two comparisons it ought not be astounded because we all ought to know by now but the thing that makes it different everybody apparently knew about Harvey Weinstein everybody that worked with them everybody that donated took money from them everybody that pal around with them all throughout Hollywood everybody you know whenever we have news reports about some executive at fox news sexual harassment is a shock and it's a starter and we never knew and nobody had any idea and it still not conclusive and yet those people are made to walk the plank and here Harvey Weinstein him gets to apologize and promise him but he's going to double down going after the M. are a as though that is going to buy him some leniency Emmett well folks you remained loyal to the because on the left and they'll tolerate anything but how transparent I saw this yesterday afternoon and I just started laughing out loud Harvey Weinstein issues whatever apologies you know I came from the sixties the %HESITATION got away with a lot more back in the sixties Harvey I came from the sixties too and I remember when the feminazi started taking over in the in the late sixties and early seventies insulted you now you just ignore them and demanding a duel with him and everybody knows that's the thing in the New York times is known about this for years what triggered this folks why all of a sudden now is the New York times breaking the seal on this something had to happen because when Harvey I want to give you some advice here buddy I never met Harvey but you're playing this all wrong apologizing and promising to bury Wayne lapierre and all that David and what you do are being you need if the to get the neck brace you learn from Ted Kennedy you got the neck brace fake an auto accident or something but get a neck brace on there as quickly as you can and then you learn from Bill Clinton have a meeting with Jesse Jackson and walk around with the Torah at least it Joey show Bible won't work but walk around with a religious book that's how Bill Clinton did it meeting with Jesse Jackson Ted Kennedy of course with the neck brace you know so many needs to ask Michelle Obama about a woman running for president who takes money from a serial abuser and sexual harasser like Harvey Weinstein remember folks everybody knew about it everybody knew about his behavior the women involved were all talking people at but why in the steam company knew everybody knew and in fact well if you have any experience reading gossip columns particularly New York post's page six the stories of what a boorish man Harvey Weinstein is are frequent and legion not a nice guy very intimidating person a lot of people scared to death particularly young budding actresses and anybody else who wants to become anything in the movie business scared to death Harvey Weinstein scared nurses when he was in the hospital to try to quit smoking he was a brute he was you know what Harvey Weinstein is is close to the prototype that young college women are being taught about men today as anybody you could come up with in public life young college women are being taught that men are predators that rape stories in all these leftist publications turned out not to be true but you know how women are being taught young college age women men are brutes manner mentor predators %HESITATION you men beat women men meet Christmas treat women are you have to shield your own kids from the father because the father is an uncontrolled just barely barely out of the cave Harvey Weinstein incomes is close to what pit demise in what the left trying to convince women men are of anybody that I know and everybody knew it now what is that mean when Hillary Clinton when Bill Clinton took Harvey wines by the way you know there's all kinds of travel log White House thought log information how many times Harvey Weinstein visit the Obama White House folks Harvey Weinstein was at the White House frequently when Bill Clinton was there and when Obama was there he was tightly was tight with Democrat presidents tight with the Democrat party a major donor a major fund raiser you threw parties for these people constantly what I'd like to see or how many trips to Chappaqua get Harvey Weinstein make when Hillary was not there but deal was how do you know what they're a lot of people out there in that man group I'm not gonna mention any names but there are a lot of people in the bill Clinton's RO what do you call it posse yeah that are I think breathing here of rather dangerously and nervously because Weinstein in might have been in and out of that posse now in them and of people looking into Weinstein who knows who else and what else they're going to find because everybody you know what folks that remains the major points of this everybody know it which makes them the biggest hypocrites on the face of the earth all of these holier than thou social justice warriors preaching about sexual harassment all these female warriors that are now I got up to represent hardy like Lisa bloom their daughter and Gloria Allred the hypocrisy here is just dripping right off your TV screen it is so thick so Hillary Clinton Bill Clinton Barack Obama take Harvey Weinstein's mommy she remained associated with them and she know this was going on a course Hillary not really a virgin and all this because she knew about her own husband similar escapades but the point is that Hillary Clinton remained silent will should try to now say that the vast right wing conspiracy was also trying to nail Harvey Weinstein along with her husband the vast right wing conspiracy they know who Harvey Weinstein was the donor community does but outside that very few do did Hillary betray her gender ladies and gentleman did Hillary betraying feminism here did Michelle my Belle Obama betrayed it did Barack Obama betray it here should the money that why in the steam donated be returned because it's now filthy should Hillary go to the microphone and the cameras and say she didn't know how I had no idea just like I did know about Benghazi I have no idea I'm I shaved I'm embarrassed I'm returning them don't hold your breath and it might become awkward for Michelle my Belle because her husband took money from Harvey to but that doesn't matter because Michelle Obama you know is the voice of reason as it were told should the money be returned they all knew I'm thinking the outrage that cam Newton yesterday verses everybody trying to cover their tracks very heh heh yeah it's bad it's bad but you know Harvey understands it now Harvey's parties on the road to rehab hard the army gets it yeah it is working hard that's the wind coming out of the pro Harvey can't cam Newton they didn't just make this guy apologized they made Ken Norton gravel yesterday and he did very well currently that you watch the football game last night the patriots on Buccaneers not nor did I nor did I but I happened to see a segment from the half time show Dion Sanders who could teach these Democrats a lot about backpedaling went away I know it's what you have to do is a cornerback Dion Sanders and bill Cowher the former coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Dion was okay he apologized he gets was more fun bill Cowher pull all in all it is not easy words don't mean anything when he needed to watch his behavior going on actions speak louder than words I'm not impressed with what he said this is after cam Newton rambled we have the audio sound bites coming up so Hollywood Hollywood blacklists conservatives that they consider to be a misogynist while promoting and protecting Harvey Weinstein and and he is ill Hollywood as the home for great pretenders is a place where Harvey Weinstein would fit right in but look at it Hollywood lectures everybody else while acting as a sanctuary city for misogynist pragmatists it is Hollywood is a sanctuary city for every reprobate leftist there is how about Roman Polanski who has been convicted of rape and he's still accepted into the Hollywood community because it is immense talent behind the camera Hillary Rodham Clinton a feminist brought if there ever was one thought Hollywood would lift her crossed the finish line last November most Democrat candidates do instead Hollywood was an anchor Hollywood was the equivalent of a cement swimsuit for Hillary Clinton you know most of us get the difference between the fiction Hollywood creates and who the creators are as people were not as stupid as ninety five percent of them think so we know the Hollywood left wheeled back up well funded and promote left wing political organizations and they will have the back of left wing social reprobate when it is necessary but I still come back to the fact that everybody knew when I say everybody I'm talking about other power brokers in Hollywood male and female I'm talking about all the politicians it winds steam powered around with and donated money to they all knew they all took his money they all accepted his invitation they invited him there's a word for that enabler there's another word for that complicit how many women were sexually harassed or assaulted because nobody spoke up the past eight years or however many years maybe decades it's been and we're not talking about cam Newton disrespect were talking about the sexual harassment of the highest order a powerful man but to hold leverage over younger ambitious women in the workplace very much like bill Clinton's behavior while governor and it president if Washington is a swamp Hollywood is a cesspool and Harvey Weinstein joins psalms special company a hall of fame if you will of male Democrat feminist Ted Kennedy Bill Clinton Bill Cosby Carlos danger and now Harvey ones take a brief time out my friends we will come back and get started with all the rest of today's program right after this having more fun than a human being should be allowed to have Rush Limbaugh on a roll on open line Friday everybody know fox they could have stopped it decades ago how many people are complicit here it is no wonder Ashley Judd's a mess it is no wonder it's because a Harvey Weinstein a fellow Democrat abused her she was abused as a child by one of her mother's boyfriends she was abused by an older man who lived in our town she's almost as cheated on abuses Hillary Clinton is not me not quite Hillary still holds a record there but for crying out loud this kind of explains a little bit why Ashley Judd has this visceral reaction that she has to trump because of what she thinks trump is trump can't hold a candle to any of this none of us can it was a a tweet from out one of the Hollywood actresses Brooklyn decker in this this makes some sense she says we can damn trump saying you're wearing grabbed women the Hollywood the NBC access Hollywood we condemn that and we can don't Harvey Weinstein even that's exactly right remember how they will old plant eight excrement over the access Hollywood video and now they're all trying to cover for hard remembered their say and this is on a couple listens wait a minute wait a minute more but they're they're they're they're they're still scared of the guides you're still trying to find ways to accommodate this not all into account and Lisa bloom that daughter of Gloria Allred who routinely appears with lines and lines of still really abused women sewing somebody Lisa bloom is having one of her books adapted by Harvey Weinstein Harvey Weinstein's adapting her book and putting it on film why don't you just love this the daughter of Gloria Allred in an attempt to help Hillary be elected represented dug out and told him what to say from the cameras numerous women who said that trump pedal last them all cases that went nowhere now her daughter also a ransom attorney is supporting Harvey who has well documented settlements of harassments going on for thirty years meanwhile Jay Z. is the husband of be on Saturday and Harvey are producing Lisa blooms series on Trayvon Martin what a cluster or it's a totally audio sound bites this morning Good Morning America George stephanopolous interviewing Lisa bloom Harvey's while you're says did he is sexually harassed women army has acknowledged yes that there was misconduct over a period of years he has certainly a very bad temper and that's a big part the problem is well known for that is a big loud guy people are intimidated by him Ashley Judd says she went for a business meeting so he proposed a massage asked if he would watch him shower issue lie no no I have great respect for Ashley Judd and so does Harvey I'm glad they come forward I encourage them to come forward Harvey has authorized me to say that I mean this is a very different day what do you do if you have behaved badly for thirty years are you going to continue or are you going to start you know a different approach that's what he's doing is what I'm really anybody else they would be trying to ruin they would be trying to ruin the with lawsuits they be trying to ruin their careers instead of praising their late arrival to maturity yeah it was unfair to give everybody know what yeah he's gross and everybody knew it yeah he hit on Ashley everybody you know it what you know what what do you do if you behave badly for thirty years you bash the N. R. A. and you bash Wayne lapierre and then you tell everybody you're not gonna stop until Wayne lapierre is in the grave or some such thing and then you get a woman the daughter of another woman to sexual harassment lawyers who participate in trying to ruin Manhattan falsely or accurately accused of it now coming to Harvey's defense and what do they do in defending admit that Harvey is a reprobate admit that art is a pig but Harvey knows it now and Harvey is trying to reform uniform now stuck with me on this folks you know nothing that happens here is isolated it all links I bring it all together every day at some point in the program everything even though it sounds isolated maybe desperate it all adds up to meaning something consistent now we're gonna story here this is from our old buddy is at the daily caller actually it's a it's a %HESITATION piece of research I think from lay witnesses to debate it with Colin sh campus reform not something about a headline college course wonders why are women are becoming more conservative Amherst College in Massachusetts offering a full course this year to try to figure out why are women are becoming more conservative the courses in title contemporary debates women and right wing populism middle explore the consequences of neo liberalism cultural conservatism Islamophobia an anti immigrant sentiments for women of different social and economic strata as well as women's divergent political responses that's the course scripture my college has a student will delve into the topic of why some women have chosen to become conservative leaders while others of allied with liberal anti racist progressive causes the our course will look at whether trans national influences have affected women's activism and will also %HESITATION examine what impact this surge of far right women has had %HESITATION it and it will have on both gender and sexuality required reading include Susan Faludi is in the dark room and of all the hand maid's tale do you know what do you know do you know what that's about you know the hands made %HESITATION handmaid's tale is I think Netflix or Hulu horses and Hulu made area mini series out of it it was written some time ago by a woman named Margaret Atwood and it is up it's dystopian as opposed to utopian and it is about the future in which women are literally nothing but servants of man for the purposes of sex I am domestic but I did it it is every cliche of the women's movement which I like when walking behind it has been for it it except it's presented as a horror story and the women in the show are dressed as though they are Amish and they're all dressed alike I mean it is it is it is a paranoid feminazis Mike where that was written a book and then made into a mini Sir and I would be my tech blogs these these these kids are reading it and I think right on man it's right on its rich right where we're headed to exactly what trump would do it's exactly what what what do were not careful meanwhile over here is Harvey Weinstein who is mistreating women who is treating them as nothing but sex objects and am Harvey Weinstein is our hero but he wants to be Harvey Weinstein wanted to Harvey Weinstein does produce movies about great progressive causes they all knew it while I'm gone TV series the handmaid's tale about how rotten conservatives treat women there's Harvey Weinstein who knows he may have invested in it I don't know how the rank hypocrisy here reeks back to Lisa bloom stick with me it all comes together folks Lisa bloom on Good Morning America George stephanopolous who by the way when the Clinton war room and one of his jobs was to identify women that we're gonna come forward and accused Bill Clinton things like Harvey Weinstein's accuse diving and Stephanopoulos is job was to help destroy them along with James Carville and others in the Clinton Walbrook it won't it won't work and now here is the lawyer Lisa bloom the daughter of Gloria Allred defending the Harvey speaking up for Harvey more so than the client would alright I'll water what about a client I'm good morning America's Stephanopoulos question Mister Weinstein appeared naked or nearly you're fully naked in front of these women requiring to be present while he bathed or asking for a massage or initiating a massage himself this one happened Ashley Judd I say it's no wonder she's affected and Stephanopoulos says listen this is a real pattern a real pattern of of of yok for over thirty years this is like textbook sexual harassment we see your client it's gross yeah it's illegal yes you know I agree I'm working with a guy who has behaved badly over the years who is genuinely remorseful who says you know I have caused a lot of pain okay he's admitted here he sexually harassed women what you're using the term sexual harassment which is a legal term so I'm using the term workplace misconduct showing some made up my son dressed for example is not sexual harassment %HESITATION workplace what what is you cannot work plays miss Ghana kinda like what the other guy in the art for hood workplace violence it is in Georgia where as well you know I got a call on me here into agreeing that that's a legal term it was more than sexual harassment folks and we've seen the guy who would want to watch him take a shower who would want to watch Harvey once you take a shower what well but wait a minute the thing is there are people answering right I would you know there are other people would especially if it meant a role in Harvey Weinstein movie %HESITATION it's not what he recently who would want to watch any man take a shower do you really have that low a self image that you can't imagine anybody wanting to watch get me man took a shower do not do not know what happens in there with it well okay speak for yourself in their Big Boy I'm just saying that there are people out there who would probably not I would do what I would do it yeah well of course men watch women do anything that that that's that's throw that out there is not a good comparison while one more Harvey I'm sorry Lisa bloom I hang if it all comes together just hang on with me now Stephanopoulos says you say your tutoring Harvey what what what what do you folks you follow this here's a thirty years and she says now that the New York times published at Harvey realizes he made a mistake do you all remember the name a needed done from the Obama administration she now she now has she has a crisis PR firm and advisory firm hang on a second screen savers interrupt me more than anything else I needed done if you remember enough it was in the summer of Obama's first term should be two thousand nine was somewhat after I won I think it was the national cathedral now like I could be wrong there was some some of going on a needed done I'm pretty sure gave a rousing endorsement of Mao tse tung and what a brilliant general he watches and how skilled he you wise at turning his country in that communism with the Cultural Revolution well it turns out to get this she was a primary adviser to Obama she was advising Harvey before the times story published so people that work for Obama who knew what Harvey did were rushing to his defense these are the same people that spare no time waste no time or expense and ruining trying to ruin Republicans or conservatives who haven't done diddly squat you're for real or by comparison so here it is Stephanopoulos you say your tutoring Harvey what does that mean that how do you tutored this got me as I explained to him things like the way you talk to your guy friends you know when you're going out for a beer is not appropriate in the workplace are you getting a lot of cursing you can't tell little stories you can't hit on women in the workplace not only is it illegal it's wrong because it causes pain to women alright and it needs to stop right you his biggest problem is anger which he says he's been in therapy and working on for ten years and I still have a long way to go on that he gets very angry he's a big guy with a loud voice and I think that's a big part the problem he is an angry guy scares everybody don't doubt me on this but you do believe this here's Lisa bloom a lawyer the daughter and Laurie alright I had to explain to Harvey things about the way you talk your guy friends you know when you're going out for a beer is not appropriate workplace come on ms bloom are you trying to tell us that Harvey so infantile he didn't know that the truth is hardly knows all this stuff he doesn't care he's Harvey Weinstein what what it this is what now they try to tell us that Harvey was naive innocently in life he didn't know that you can't talk around women the way you talk with guys having a bigger come on what kinda saps do you think your audience well now that I ask that it is the Good Morning America audience and it could be comprised of many saps but even so it is an insult you are in touch it I had to tell Harvey that you can't tell sex stories to women yes you can if a woman loves you if a woman no issue if you ever relationship whether yes you can is just you can't with women that don't know you or her need something out of you besides that if they want to work for your work that he doesn't know this he knows all of this this is what is like Clinton and his numerous apologies I I've I frankly I was unaware I I've added the house come across us so some of these women you mean when your hand was what that's right I had no idea that that that that was a objectionable really what Ellery never did really okay things these people trying to get away with now let's go back to Vegas shall we this morning on CNN's new day the fill in cohost poppy Harlow spoke with Las Vegas shooting survivor Stephanie Melanson about meeting the president trump in first when a melodica trunk and poppy Harlow said you guys you got to meet with the president the First Lady and that was really meaningful can you tell us about it even a small man they're real people he is around she is around you they had a hard they were carrying there are some I thought it they have a listening here yes themselves condone sense before he had finished talking she got out then beeline over to us and just hugged me and hold on a your mom a strong is a fighter she'll be okay gonna make now when it wasn't part popping her look like she's about to vomit this is not the message that CNN wants on there about trump made a mistake here not knowing what this patient was gonna side but now listen to this you guys got to meet the president First Lady and you tell us about it even in this moment they're real people he's a real human she's a real human they have a heart they were carrying that was news that was news who knows what this woman believed of Donald Trump before she met and I think we have a pretty good idea if you pay is intent on those at all she thinks it trumps the pavement trumps a reprobate the trunk whatever kind of bad you can think of and multiply it times ten because that's what the media's been telling her all this time Harvey wise use of quiet guy Hollywood loves Harvey Weinstein is one of the movers and shakers in for thirty years they knew he was a reprobate looked the other way they make up they lie about Donald Trump when people meet Donald Trump human heart they were caring they were sympathetic breaking news C. N. N. Donald and melania trump are human beings with a heart that was the breaking those this is all such a such a freaking mess and everywhere you go everywhere you go you want an explainer he won't find out why the media is involved there is your answer let's not start on the fall job way we %HESITATION we have jam in Houston jail now you're up first on open line Friday great to have you with us today highrise I cannot believe I'm speaking to you I have been listening to you for years and years and years live free share really do and I'm glad you made it through and that was one of the times that I would listen to you was while I was working at the Weinstein company that would stream their print him everyday where is it where was that where were you what were relaxed when you go to work in which work twice have I lived in New York in New York as for the last decade know someone had reported here Max and white screen well like so you know what you've been there are you know you've been there a long time I'm not here now I moved back to Texas in two thousand ten I say it was so what do you think of all the lists I think it's the whole area I think that it is amazing that all coming to light now when everyone's known about this stuff for amber well I have a question for you and I know expect you to amid this is not accusatory don't miss our semi Tallinn but you did work there and you said like we all know not everybody know why didn't anybody step forward do you think armor I think part of it was the intimidation factor and is very powerful and he had a a long rein in Hollywood making Oscar caliber self rule can do so what's changed and wires wise the times run this with that and they've moment the been working on this for years Harvey tried to threaten about a running it but they ran it they're standing by up I his lawyers admitting that all this is basically true but she's tutoring him she's gonna be a good boy now what what why now there has to be a reason I'm not sure I mean I think his power has started to wane a bit in Hollywood well that would mean he's out of money wise that would mean is on the money when you're out of money in Hollywood you're out of power so that would mean maybe it's got financial problems and that's what I was thinking that my own that I mean that's kind of been plaguing the company for awhile and I I know it speaking as an authority on that day just what I read in the paper now what did you do there and what was your job I'm I everyone's going to know who I am but they're talking about all this that I I would you want that wait a minute you don't want to do that I'm just don't have to do that it'll have to I'm not asking you to %HESITATION violate any security that you want him here some rain I will say that I did not and have a direct dealings with ham on a day to day basis I did it encounter have in the office but I was not one of these people who no work directly for hammer has experience in hotel rooms with him nothing to that extent yeah it's more like it just hearing staff than I enjoyed hearing stories about hand in Hollywood in general and but it wasn't it was a fun place to work perfect pink yeah was Hollywood I mean it's not movie business I understand the lower and lower I do I'm Jane hang on here just second odd don't go away but we'll be back in just second but but always follow the money I I know there's been stories and that the company being out of money but I mean more than that that could explain why no but okay markets open line Friday all please try to take more phone calls if you're on hold %HESITATION I am requesting that you be patient stay that I'm gonna try to get because we got a lot of good ones here hang on I'm gonna try to get to you mix it all in with everything else coming up on the program which I can't wait to get to ||||||||||| welcome to today's edition of bulrush twenty four seven podcast Hey funds almost feel like there is a half day all I have is the radio show today and that's no answer we did our fourth hour yesterday which actually was a I for a fourth and a half hour Wheeler hour and a half yesterday after the program would know commercial break you know what else I forgot to take phone calls I'm gonna write a wrap it up in about twenty eight minutes and this notice is you got a whole bunch of phone calls here hello is an odd Jews one of the reasons I did this was to get phone calls and I got so wrapped up in the concept that I am for god and then and then the last call a guy was kinda snarky I remember about what but he was not guilty and held on for a long time but it wasn't a snarky about something else anyway it was a lot of fun yesterday and that the substance of the content of that era additional hour and a half will eventually end up on the on the free side of Rush Limbaugh dot com but thanks to all of you subscribers it too and and our telephone number as always is eight hundred two eight two two eight eight to the email address I'll rush balik EIB net dot you else some of the things discussed yesterday on the fourth and a half hour will be revitalized or not revitalized but data revived today because there are now things to add to such as the status of the Republican Party have spent a lot of time yesterday afternoon on the fourth hour describing what I think was going on with the Republican Party can today we have a story from the new Republic that is the exact opposite of my tech and that takes in the new Republic is that the Republican Party is getting stronger every day they're not happy about it at the new Republic but that all of this that's happening is actually making the party stronger in terms of winning elections not in terms of advancing an agenda don't misunderstand Republican party's agenda is stalled pretty much but in terms of winning elections verses are Democrats it is the theory of the fear of a writer at the new Republic and it's %HESITATION it's it's it's getting stronger and better and the Democrats remain in him big due to so we'll have the addition of that coming up there also a couple things in yesterday that went over so well that I'm gonna have to revive those today %HESITATION as well those are cultural and %HESITATION news stories that dead and not related and expose well over some of it related to specific segment of today but as all ways we start well if Las Vegas here we are more than three days later we still have no motive for the Las Vegas shorter even after talking to his girlfriend who by the way is an Australian citizen who was apparently married to Americans at one time and who appears to have used to different social security numbers and numerous aliases she also seems to have lived in numerous places at the same time I don't know if anybody's ever asked about her legal status in this country I don't know she has a green card I don't know if she is a full fledged citizen she is a native of the Philippines it always goes back to the Philippines seems like a circles back do the Philippines she's a navy of she has up Australian citizenship an Australian passport but I don't know what her circumstances are in this country out of she has a green card or some special visa to allow her to live in the country all these years now we're being told that Patrick shooter gave her somewhere between a hundred thousand a hundred and twenty six thousand dollars to buy a house in the Philippians and we haven't heard anybody raise the question about the house could've been part of paddocks escape plan do you hope to hide out in the Philippines ever doing this are being told that he had an escape plan %HESITATION which puts the kibosh on the suicide by cop theories we also said that that there was a picture of the suite which she stated that it looked like there might've been a note people thinking might have been a suicide note it wasn't that and the law enforcement officials in Las Vegas are increasingly saying that it just it could not have done this a long that he had to have some help somewhere along the way which means if true that there's somebody else who knew what was going on there are now other people gore claiming there was a second shorter we're gonna have a grassy knoll aspect of there was a second shooter somebody is convinced there had to be a second shooter we also know that the shooter or somebody else tried to blow up the jet fuel tanks across the street at McCarran International Airport this guy was supposedly highly educated as scientists very knowledgeable wealthy and all that but didn't know you couldn't blow up jet fuel tanks by firing into them they are protected I get and jet fuel those nights kerosene and there are steps that are taken for just this kind of attempt that they don't totally prevent but they take great steps to make sure that does such attempts firing bullets and so forth and the tanks would not result in an explosion they found a couple holes in the jet fuel tanks they patched them out rather quickly so the political debate now rages on and it has reached the usual hysterical proportions as regards the pot politics of all of this I saw today don't show prep on TV I glanced up during show prep on ice as a somebody was saying I was reading it close capturing if somebody was saying as it in passing and the New York times today have called for me repeal a second a member so what I found out it's not I don't I don't know if they did it in an editorial but there is an op ed piece by Bret Stephens noted conservative columnist who moved over to the New York Times and the wallstreet journal remember his first piece almost resulted in him being killed by New York times readers I forget what he did or said that all yeah he made he made a reference a global warming as a as a as a hoax or some this is something that's been totally miss reported and the New York times' readership our I had I had a collective hissy fit and started questioning why he was even hired in the the pool buyers of The New York Times had to write excuses and reasons why I'd been hired tell people they're interested in open free exchange of all kinds of ideas which isn't true but yes he has a piece today repeal the second amendment it's not a satire piece and it is our it's not a smart piece you simply saying if everything I hear everybody saying about guns is true there's only one way to fix this immense to repeal a second amendment you when we talk about have you really wanted carry this out to its logical conclusion based on what everybody's saying including Democrat you gotta get rid of the second amendment now that isn't going to happen and there's some things in here that are in conflict with some information that we have passed on earlier this week for instance the opening of a Colin from a personal safety standpoint more guns means less safety the FBI counter to total two hundred and sixty eight justifiable homicides by private citizens robbing firearms in two hundred and two thousand fifteen and that is felons killed in the course of committing a felony yet that same year there were four hundred and eighty nine unintentional fire arms death in the U. S. according to the centers for disease control between seventy seven one hundred forty one of those killed were children now this is all off the map because I'm I'm reading that there are thirty three thousand gun deaths every year and the two thirds of them are suicides and we have that chart that comes from the American enterprise institute but tabulate the sale of guns it's nineteen ninety four and shows that guns sales have increased by in ninety four percent in that same period homicides by guns this is not suicides this is murdered Mrs what the left thinks happens with every gun death but it's a homicide somebody shoot somebody those numbers are down forty nine percent I haven't seen anybody dispute those numbers they've been out there for awhile now %HESITATION a E. I the American enterprise institute is a reputable think tank so we have a a bit of conflicting David here Stevens is numbers are nowhere near thirty three thousand a year that that is bandied about and you need that number if you're also going to try to fool fallacious we claim that there are more gun deaths every year in America total is now greater than all of the deaths that it happened in all of the combined wars in American history that's a stat that we mentioned yesterday that can also be not refuted because it it's very misleading thirty three million women two thirds of of gun deaths are suicides and not murder in their non homicide and gun control there's that there's no no law that would stop that there's no new gun regulation that would stop that which just even just point all these little regulations are nice talking about this new law that new regulation do that on **** stocks don't do that again he says it's nothing unite accomplish anything except making people think you care here really serious about this get rid of the second amendment I did just point is that nobody is really serious about I'm the point he's trying to make is look yeah I'm listening these people and the only thing that they could possibly really mean as I listen to them is get rid of the second amendment but I don't think he thinks anybody's going to ever do that although we think it's possible he thinks it would be a possible to get rid oddly second amendment using gay marriage as an analogy nobody ever thought gay marriage will become the law of the land that it did likewise nobody ever thinks we get rid of the second amendment but we could sense we legalize gay marriage that's is thinking on this OB he cites law enforcement officials who claim that more guns it was less safety not according to the numbers that we have been using this week and I'm I'm I have no vested interest in any of this our other than accuracy so I I if if if these numbers that AE I is using or not true I would want to know that be able to retract about haven't had anybody refute that and in fact it it makes logical common sense a bit but what people try to say is the common sense is that more guns the more violence and more guns the more danger the more guns the last safety well that's what you might logically think but it may not be the case when talking about homicides homicides does not encompass every every crime more activity involving the use of a gun such as suicide such as accidental firings not such as unintentional firings the homicide your specific area and when talking about homicides the number of gun homicides are down almost equal to the number of new guns sold since nineteen ninety four so his point is he also takes on Jimmy Kimmel here a little bit he says the national rifle association does not have Republican balls on the money clip is Jimmy Kimmel put it the other night DR a has donated a paltry three and a half million dollars to all current members of Congress since nineteen ninety eight according washing post by the way is the amount of money donated to Democrats by unions dwarfs the amount of money donated by the M. R. eight everybody it didn't even close balks the N. R. A. another with people calling the NRA a terrorist organization there are college professors that are it like Tina Sinatra thirteen Nancy's tonight pick up one of the Sumatra daughters is out there saying the NRA should be lined up and shot by firing squad now that's an illustration of the hysteria and how successful it has it's been created here but Stevens is point is that the NRA doesn't need to buy influence it's powerful because it's popular doesn't need to buy all this influence on the fact that it has doesn't mean that much %HESITATION that also is is arguable but this is the paragraph preceding his claim the more closely one looks at what passes for common sense gun laws the more fat Gillis they appear Americans who claim to be outraged by gun crime should want to do something more than Tinker at the margins of a legal regime that most of the developed world rightly considers knots they should want to change it fundamentally impermanent there's only one way to do this repeal the second amendment if point is that there's no serious effort to do this although I think there is I think that's the ultimate aim of the left it's like everything else they just won't come out and say so they're not gonna come out in and specify their agenda they would lose an even bigger numbers than I have been losing recently at any rate Bret Stephens in the New York times a conservative columnist is just one example of the thinking that is out there you know this was going to kill you know the next day was going to hit bumps stocks they all knew that it was learned that the perpetrator here was using bump stocks to convert his semi automatic rifles and guns and so forth to automate you know that it wasn't gonna take long before somebody in Congress in the Senate was going to move forward and suggest a new law banning guns stock got bumped stocks and that has happened senator Dianne Feinstein of California has filed a bill art to do just that you have all of these leftists out there and folks I'm sorry we we must categorizing to find the people who are saying what they're saying because they have something in common the leftists have a view of this the non leftist seven view the leftists are all now demand and we got rid of bumps stocks and the Republicans asked as predictable have members saying you know we're talking about now book talked about that once the hawks yeah we can't find a legitimate response to auction okay fine you want about it Republicans remain eager across the aisle and show that they are willing to work with lunatics rather than stand up to a here's what nobody is talking about the book stock green light received approval from the A. T. F. during the Obama administration the Obama administration authorized to bump stocks that's not supposed to be possible Obama was one of the emotional should be one that was going to get rid of the second amendment Obama supposedly because the good left us a good liberal he wanted to take guns away you telling me that it was the Obama A. T. F. authorize bonds stocks yes yes Mattel there it's certainly one a couple things on bomb stocks here we don't know we still don't know for a fact that paddock used month stocks on Wall Street journal study at automatic weapons in the drive bys reporting based on anonymous sources that Pat I can't tour maybe twelve bomb stocks in his hotel room we still don't know one of the problems that people have with mumps knocks people use them as they they because rifles to jam because the rebels had not intended to be fired this way and if they don't jam they cannot over heat if either happen you can't use the weapon now we know that paddock stopped shooting on his own he may have had to because his mum stocked rifle jammed her overheated if in fact he was using one you hear what Tim Kaine said Tim came then asinine theory that paddock stopped shooting because he didn't have a silencer it I have I watched the video they body cam video that's about three minutes long it's eerie it's shelling it ends you see the stuff on TV you know it's not real watching on TV but every time you hear the gunfire on that video from body cam of one of the cops in Las Vegas you know people have been mowed down its them it's just chilling it's it just it's just terrifying and thirty seconds would go by and then that would ring out again and and go for fifteen or twenty seconds then stopped and everybody would run in training deadly they would come again it was just it was chilling couldn't see much but you didn't have to just hearing it and knowing what was happening showing enough as it is meeting and surpassing all audience expectations every day Rush Limbaugh America's real anchor man here the Limbaugh institute telephone number eight hundred two eight two two eight eight to the email address L. rush moment E. IBM that dot you Estes goalie audio sound bites here's Chuck you're Schumer and this is on the Senate floor this morning in Washington %HESITATION but just listen this kind of speaks for its sewage we could talk to those brave souls who were killed and are now in heaven they would say do something they won't say let's wait president trump are you going to wait to hear what the NRA says first you fashion yourself as a strong man well are you going to show that you are not beholden to anyone now are you going to show your strength now are you going to be the first president Republican president in a generation to block the NRA I say to president trump call now and say that you support and would sign a law to ban bump stocks here I feel like doing feel like doing a monologue addressing all of those babies who've been killed by Planned Parenthood and asking what they would be saying if they could speak they would be saying do something shut down Planned Parenthood there are over a million abortions a year in the United States of America war frightened her number of homicides every year it's been the case since nineteen seventy three at the minimum we don't know the numbers prior but do you have to think that they're close a million taxi over a million abortions a year and who it is sue is it is beholden to the NRA according to Chuck Schumer let me tell you who's beholden to Planned Parenthood that's a Democrat party the Democratic Party and every other faction of the Democrat party is beholden to the and as it took to Planned Parenthood far more than anybody who's beholden the in Iraq if we can talk to those brave babies who were killed in the womb and they're now in heaven they would say do something they wouldn't say well let's wait senator Schumer are you gonna wait to hear what Planned Parenthood says first you fashion your shop was a strong man the senator Schumer were you going to show that you're not beholden to anyone now including Planned Parenthood you gonna show your strength now are you gonna be the first senator on the Democrat side to Bach Planned Parenthood I say to senator Schumer come out and say that you support and wouldn't sign a law to ban abortions how do you think that would fly what senator Schumer can venture to the floor of the Senate and start impugning the M. R. A. which hasn't killed anybody which does not support the killing of anybody which does not have locations in strip malls and other public places where you can go win and then the lists the help of the NRA in killing people they don't know that you can't do that with the NRA you can do that with Planned Parenthood in fact the Democrat party urges people to do just that as they have politicized abortion so I'm sorry senator Schumer if you're a plaintiff leave here speaking to the Braves souls in heaven and how they want trump to band bump stocks I think there's a group of people in heaven who care a little bit more about Bob stocks senator Schumer here's Nancy Pelosi her weekly press conference in Washington on Capitol Hill we have to act now and we're not going the way we've told the families we have to pass something and I'll only solicits blossoms when something cars and then we have a flurry of condoms also on the other side of the aisle saying this is not the time now is not the time no it's now time for a moment of silence and no time of for action see that we got to do something we have to pass something we have to show people that we're doing something we have to show people we care we have to show what the past something it doesn't matter what it is you can make welcome if that were going to pass a law that bans mom stocks before we even find out for sure whether or not the guy used you can smell this one coming you can see this was governed why because they know they've got to do something when something like this happens everybody thinks something has to happen in Washington and if something happens in Washington we're fixing it except where not because Washington has a unique ability to avoid placing blame where it belongs what do you think searching for a motive is really all about I'll guarantee you what to some people searching for a motive means they're looking for a way to blame political opponents Ford not this guy this guy if the left has its way is going to be a victim he's gonna have come under the influence of one of the democratic party's enemies that's what the hope is that's why they're gonna delay and delay and delay coming up with a motive because they're holding out hope that they can lay it off on trump somehow if not that light off on fox knows if not that lay it off on talk radio if not that light off on something to do with conservatism of the Republican Party at large that point that I made yesterday in the fourth and a half hour broadcast that it wasn't a broadcast it was a webcast what is the ara what is the situation what are the circumstances in America at the point in time of this massacre would you describe America as well be and positive and forward really energetic I'm talking about at large because certainly in pockets of this country you'll find just that and those people probably are not watching those the happiest people in this country the most content people probably is an economic %HESITATION aspect to it but they probably don't watch the news as such they are not barrage each and every day with a eight pummeling okay absolute negativity pessimism and disaster but most people are pummeled but that's not visionary day so in what in one mood did did this massacre take place didn't take place in a mode of up left and inspiration and positive even though there are stories about how economic confidence is that way record high the last ten or fifteen years I'm they're in there isn't there number of you cherry pick come %HESITATION Paul's that will show you that on balance the American people are optimistic about some things but overall what what what do you want to mind seven American you have to say that America's on edge is it not that America's a constant chaos America's in constant crisis if the NFL it's whatever college campus and a black my black lives matter you have snow flakes are refusing to allow certain kind of speech on college campus you got riots going on all over the country at least we're told so and depending on what you read rape is happening regularly on college campuses all over the country if it isn't in that context that this shooting took place what if and nobody knows and if they don't know they're not telling us what if this guy got caught up in all that negativity just got plain ticked off he's already have some grievances went into what they are there is personal life but you can't escape this stuff and not everybody is well adjusted with discipline insanity some people living on the edge out there this guy from what we have been told has been planning this for a long long time so maybe the current context mood of America is not a factor but you can't ignore it you'd have to say that this event took place at a time when America's culture and society and politics are at full boil if you're looking for a motive might that matter or is all of that irrelevant when looking for a motive but I listen to Chuck Schumer pretending to speak to the dead did and telling us that their thoughts are on make an aha a I listen to Nancy Pelosi we've got a good we don't don't don't don't think and I just have to wonder what their desire is because these people politicize everything when when it comes to motive I don't doubt for a minute that they are hoping that they can use whatever the motive is to advance their political agenda and if not do that to inflict great damage on their political opponents agenda meaning there is I have no doubt that pelo see and Schumer and all the rest I would love to be able in their kitchen for it love to be able to link this guy to their political opponents I take a break we'll come back we will continue right after those folks don't go away I wonder senator Schumer has talked a prince in heaven my what prince thanks about all of this this is prince remember rotation here nineteen ninety nine and we start on the phones in Pittsburgh the home of the a bit of a conference hall going on between Antonio brown and memorize lists burger in the Pittsburgh Steelers Dave great to have you Sir how are you Grammy on Ross yes Sir I have a point here about the Vegas shoot air %HESITATION it seems that the last does not believe in evil unless of course your trump supporter then you're racist sexist barriers we disagreed the last thing you're pure evil but even the shooter who massacred all these people molesters not axiom is evil in fact they're blaming everything and everybody else do you believe %HESITATION guns they're blaming the NRA they're blaming bump stock they even were starting to blame the hotel staff because they didn't call accounts because he brought to much luggage and indeed they're getting brain and the only thing that they really want is they want to find some way to link desperate trumps somehow or to the right then they complain trumpet call him a murderer employment for the whole entire thing they don't want to call that you're right that they don't want to call a murderer they want to say he doesn't care they want to say he's beholden to the NRA that is the NRA that's killing people then that they are a doesn't care and because the NRA gives all kinds of money the Republicans can I give a lot Democrats too by the way I thought that they don't care that's what they want to say you're actually right the the left sees it Ivo everywhere in all the wrong places every political opponent of theirs is not just to put political opponent he or she is evil and that designation is what permits the left to do anything they can to defeat the if you're stamping out evil there are no boundaries there are no limits on what you should do not can't do and that's how they believe it I'm just folks I just want tell you again what Chuck Schumer dead on the Florida Senate today is so unprofessional it's it's it's outrageous doesn't even cover it to attempt on the floor of the United States Senate to attempt to say that if you can talk to the dead from Las Vegas that they would be saying get the on Iraq grab somebody's gonna here is audio sound bites number one this this is what we're up against fox here's the purity talk to those brave souls who were killed and are now in heaven they would say do something they wouldn't say let's wait president trump are you going to wait to hear what the NRA says first use not bashing yourself as wait a minute I thought the attendee is were all country western fans and that means they're all trump fan luge so why would they be blaming trump senator Schumer and here's the Democrat party invoking heaven number one's a bit of a stretch to me but number two senator shimmered the NRA doesn't kill anybody the NRA does not have locations where you can go and have them killed something that you will find inconvenient yeah arrays never killed anybody be beholden to the NRA how about being beholden to Planned Parenthood Sandra how about how about channeling all of the multiple millions of dead babies in heaven and asking them what they think of the Planned Parenthood abortion centers and how if anybody waits to hear what Planned Parenthood says it's you people in the Democrat party you're gonna be the first in your party senator to talk Planned Parenthood if it's death but you're worried about if it's deaf that you are sol horribly offended by there's a lot of places you can go besides the N. R. A. which doesn't kill anybody they don't even advocate for the killing of anybody under the guise of some other right I know what you call that I that's just if we can talk to those brave souls who were killed or now and have a day wouldn't say do something the president Drummond do something about the NRA grab some by number three the insanity continued last night on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon Hillary Clinton I can't believe that one whole political party in the greatest country on earth is totally sold to the gun lobby and will do what ever they are ordered to do despite the loss of life I mean one of the first things that you know trump signed as president was to reverse president Obama's ordered the people with no serious mental health problems should not be able to buy guns and so he signed it and aren't you happy that people we already know who have mental health problems can now buy guns that's just simply not true it's Mrs Clinton who may be mentally ill be that just isn't true but once again it's Mrs Clinton who was a member of a party totally sold to the abortion lobby and will do what ever they are ordered to do buys that abortion lobby Planned Parenthood despite the loss of life Mrs Clinton your the ones in and explaining to do here not the M. are a you know folks on second thought it may not be all that strange that senator Schumer thinks that he can speak with them for the dead because we know that the dead routinely vote for the Democrats every two or four years so it may not be all that outrageous
