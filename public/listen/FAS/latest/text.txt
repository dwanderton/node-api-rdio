on delta you have no reason to stop the conversations you're having on the ground when you get in the clouds my guest is Jimmy Fallon the host of The Tonight Show who was on the show once before when he was hosting late night this is the first time I've interviewed him since he took over the tonight show in twenty fourteen we're gonna talk about the tonight show and lots of other things first we're going to talk about his new children's book everything is mama it's his second book for children just beginning to learn language each page as an illustration of a mother animal teaching her baby animal a new word the mother holds up an object and points to it and says what it is like shoe or waffle or balloon and instead of repeating the mother's words the baby animal response to each new word by saying mama on Tuesday the day the book was published kill o'neill came on the tonight show and read the book out loud with Jimmy Fallon on his lap nnova Judy my god yeah everything is momo according to you but they're all the former worlds no want to move to sun mama won't pull my love my up and get it and getting tattoos mom must be getting tired now and my server no ma ma the phone will convince you the fresh air so that was a that was a moment so what was the process for you of deciding how to introduce your book on your show it's tricky because what my show would normally I'm there to sell other people's things or bring awareness to other people's things so it's it's odd to have something that that I'm I'm Bob what so it every now and then if someone brings it up for anything about kids books is only that I can go oh yeah I have a kids book if you hadn't your Shaquille o'neal's laugh while if there is that had I didn't know he wanted me to have mothers lap yeah I I knew that he was going to say something about the book is what I can he said like I want to mention something about dad dad or some because last time he said they enjoyed the data book or something so I said sure not knowing that he wanted me to sit on his lap like of course you know how you want me to read this I want to come up over here and also you have to read this book to as I okay I don't know what to do because cities lift me up before he has I mean Shaquille o'neal's very big man he can kind of do whatever he wants to me I once put his suit blazer on just to see what it would look like I mean it was like observe wrapped in a like a queen bed like a sheet like a okay comforter was like the largest thing everybody had sleeves %HESITATION and it was amazing %HESITATION so when I walked over to us alright just good sit on my lap so I just that all right here in this site because I look like a little baby he's holding me and as I was laughing he's reading the book to me it is very me laugh so what why have you started writing children's books is it because you have children known you've been reading to them yeah it's fascinating they're getting to the age now there at four and two and a half where they're actually starting to the four year old started to memorize books and kind of de almost pretend like she is reading you know it's it's really enchanted I'm literally watching someone learn how to read in front of me and so I figured that it be kind of fun to have a children's book just so I can say all of this is something Daddy Rhoden hopefully %HESITATION you know read with them which I did the idea of the first book I had a book called your baby's first word will be Dada and the idea was it was a joke that %HESITATION husbands and wives or you know %HESITATION have a thing of the unknown Spokane contest of what the baby's first word would be is gonna be mama's gonna be data so I would love the baby's first word be dead as just a selfish thing and so I would go all around the house our first child and I every time I sorry if I give her a bottle or gave her food or change a diaper I would take you on a data plummeted that that is what you want has time for dad that I just kept saying we're dead hopefully you know did maybe fake the kid out so that she just keeps repeating the same the where dad that you know I at this point in care of the kid was unintelligent I figured that that you would learn later on but out so I did that did not work and so %HESITATION I turns out I'm not a very accomplished child psychologist like I thought it was weird how it father apparently or to be I think a very cruel for itself idea but then they put out a book called your baby's first word will be Dada where it's just different animals doing animal sounds and then the baby animals are saying dad that back and I read this to the second child and it worked and the baby's first word was data are you reading books to children that were read to you when you were their age yes the exact books in fact I've saved my books from when I was a kid %HESITATION when my favorites is well there's a monster at the end of this book %HESITATION is the Grover book where he keeps warning you not to turn the page because he's afraid it's Sesame Street knees crying is like please don't turn the page but please visit the page like a you know there's a monster at the end of this book tortured building a wall see don't open you have to knock down the brick wall a wall why you doing this please don't turn the page again you know and then he's putting a rope on the thing and he's using a wooden he's hammering that don't and there's a monster at the end of this book when you do that you know and it turns at the end the monster is Grover he is the monster at the end the booking goes and you are so scared of course is just me into it says and I love the because it was funny it taught me bravery I guess that you know that I just love the book my kids love it to this day I read them that all the time my question is you had a happy childhood you've said you had a happy childhood really did I know that what we offer comedian yes Sir that's gonna save is out for a comedian so many comedians run on depression anger resentment and had like really difficult childhoods do you think that like your sense of humor was affected by the fact that you say you had a happy childhood yeah I mean I have to I mean to be really honest terrified press I went to therapy maybe that something would be unearthed but I don't think so I think I really did have a happy childhood how does a happy kid Jim if you go to therapy they'll honor things about your happiness to okay okay gets a little harder show is something that is a win win okay get kids go get something in there yeah but I remember there was a report card from kindergarten and %HESITATION the comment from the teacher was %HESITATION Jimmy smiles too much which is very interesting what an odd thing to say about a child but I think like I wouldn't smile even when it's getting yelled at you know our toll like Hey knock it off for will stop fooling around I would just like go okay I just always had a happy kid you know do you think that being reasonably happy affected the kind of comedy you do you I think so yeah I mean I was very I don't know this prudish or you know I I very like a lot of my material I know I was on my parents seeing in my grandparents CMake grandparents %HESITATION helped raise me you know they lived in our backyard kind of like they had a cottage right behind our house and so I was I was hanging out my grandma my grandpa everyday you know they taught me to drive and all that stuff growing up and it was very kind of a clean comedian I never cursed third said anything risque and my and my acts just growing up I mean the older I've gotten I've kind of expanded a little bit more but %HESITATION my first couple ax was just very squeaky clean those out very happy that that's where I was I was raised because a I think it's harder to make a those jokes to make comedy funny if you don't have any profanity here anything dirty do you remember anything from those early performances yeah my goodness I mean I I started out my mom heard about a contest on the radio an impression contest and she said %HESITATION Jimmy should ensure this impression contest you have three minutes to do an impression and you do all these voices in your bedroom %HESITATION intagram like Haiti you can hear what I'm doing a lot better now that I'm like yeah but if we think that's it stop there I go but I go maybe I can do something and someone gave me a troll doll clothes graduating high school as price sixteen or seventeen at the time and they give me a troll doll with a graduation cap on as in like go graduate %HESITATION but I took the hat off into the diploma on tonight use that might three men acting I said I would do different impersonations of people trying to be the spokesperson for the stroll down so I would say like a first up the auditions a Jerry Seinfeld I go okay table okay but what good does this guy crazy yeah his arms and legs down move who plays in the suburbs all you know and %HESITATION and then I go and next up %HESITATION peewee Herman like that I like to play these dolls I declared myself down data and say in the %HESITATION I won this contest and so I was seventeen I think at the time and I did three minutes I did all that did probably twelve impressions and I won I want to say is like seven hundred dollars or something crazy in three minutes that I'm never going home and laying and that the money out of my kitchen table and we took a picture of it and this is when this before digital photos I mean we took a picture had to this is that you get is out you take twelve of them and pick the best one out so we have a photo like all this cash on my kitchen table and me standing behind it like wow is comedy this easy I mean I can just do it three minutes to get seven hundred dollars that gets amazing this is what I would do for the rest of my life and it turns out that Congress not that easy like this is a rare thing you know it's funny the other time that you on our show before you were hosting The Tonight Show you talked about how when you auditioned for Lorne Michaels for Saturday Night Live you did the troll routine and %HESITATION they didn't hire you the hair tracing Oregon but they called you back for another addition and Lauren said but don't do the troll routine no she would trust us we've seen the troll doll that had more fun with and move on let's do something else and that that's all I have LA half my whole leg of the work and the troll redeem them at this point I was twenty three so all my experiences that I move to LA and I was working at the improv out there on Melrose %HESITATION Avenue and I yeah taking lessons at the Groundlings and taking acting lessons with Gordon hunt Helen hunt's dad which was not asleep Gordon hunt probably thought I was an idiot I went to this acting class and this is like those really studying like Buddha Haagen and all these things acting like look at me right so I I go in and I was really into James Dean at the time I remember this and I go James Dean I read all his biographies he never acted in his acting class he just observed and I go home cool that is so James Nichols so I would go to his class I pay money which I didn't have but I pay money for this class and I would say not just wanna observe and I would sit in the back of the class is what's the acting class news like Jimmy sure I mean you should just get down here and I try I don't know couldn't get us gonna just gonna observe and he's like I I gotta be honest I really think you you're wasting your time but okay if you want to just sit back and and so I kind of just did that I didn't really act in the acting classes but it really paid off I think that puts you as you can see in my movie roles it's I can in order to be James Dean because you're so different from James Dean I mean I think this series taken his romance always like holding so much in in his his this like you know like romantic figure %HESITATION who's holding all the CNN intelligence like explodes out of him and %HESITATION he has this kind of like reserve an inner cool and your soul is seemingly like extroverted I loved him I love river Phoenix I loved Leonardo DiCaprio they're my favorite actors and I think that just because they just look so cool you know and they're they're just were so cool in every scene I go I'd love to be able to do that of course people want to do what they're not good at I think it's just a thing that happens with actors or comedians or whoever was like I remember after I got sat live for a little while I told my agents ago I don't wanna do any movies that unless it's a western if you really think you realize that you don't make western thinking we would be talking about I go I want to be like shot off a horse is something I just wanna be a cowboy I'm what don't do any movies unless it's a western and they're right I disguise that difficult man is like but why would I not want to do a comedy because that's a clearly what I'm what I'm best at but you know it's just those phase you have to go through I mean we all right so what what role did you see here's where you the sheriff were you on the guy who's given a guns because like sterling Hayden and %HESITATION enter any guitar you're right yeah but you don't have a gun but like you're so tough when you're so cool you're gonna win no matter what anyway yeah I probably was the sidekick to the cool guy home where I still is kind of cool but I I in my head I saw myself getting shot off a horse which again is it when I go to therapy that something's going to come out of the but I know I've been excise of with a good fall I love falling I mean I still love Chevy Chase and growing up nice to practice following of fall down the stairs I would trip and knock things over on purpose you know I I'm real I'm still very good tripping and falling I would do Jerry Lewis and and Chevy Chase moves %HESITATION all the time I mean I've heard great Chevy Chase stories %HESITATION Lorna's told me they seems like a Chevy is so funny there we go to a restaurant so would be Lorne Belushi %HESITATION ill Lorraine Newman Gilda they be out to dinner and Chevy go okay I'm a get up and I'm gonna trip and violence that waiter without the water and they %HESITATION Chevy please don't do this please don't because now I'm going to do that please don't because that they don't wanna laughed knowing it by selecting new things gonna do it and he would spend all time walk all the way around the restaurant and they come from a different angle than trip and then knock into away not water glasses everywhere and they would try to sit there and try to not laugh like that it knows habit Butler said it was the funniest thing ever and he would do it all the time my guest is Jimmy Fallon the host of The Tonight Show support for this NPR podcast in the following message come from Gillette the thousands of men and women that you lack never stopped working harder to make your shape better and now give blades for less visit Gillette dot lower prices pricing applies to select products and is the sole discretion of the retail it seems to me like your monologue it's gotten more political from when you started on the tonight show you do trump jokes in most of your opening monologues %HESITATION have you to change the balance do you think I mean I think it changed the balance of political humor in the monologue %HESITATION a little bit I mean we've always told jokes about the president or anyone we can make fun of in the White House or Congress or you know we don't you know any politicians always good for a laugh you know %HESITATION I feel like we like to mix it up usually we would you like forty percent political jokes and sixty percent jokes about anything you know whatever pop culture thing because that's what I'm actually more interested in than politics I don't I'm not that interested in and politics %HESITATION but %HESITATION these days with our president and everything that he is I mean every day this five new scandals are things in your life it's just these are top stories and you have to see if you can find a job which is kind of hard sometimes %HESITATION but if you can you have to just tackle it so that at least you I I don't know %HESITATION kind of got that joke well you you kind of put that choke away okay good now that's that and you made a joke about that dead image of what this paper every day this like five but it's I mean %HESITATION you know we come in our writers like I don't know where else we can go but now if he just in start another fight with somebody else and so or something else going on just getting it's just crazy so I think now we're more sixty political and forty fun poppy jokes you know the thing is even if you're not political president trump has been involving himself inserting himself in like every aspect of popular culture football his reviews of Saturday Night Live when he doesn't like an impression of him I mean he's just he's just is appearing in everything there's like no getting away from from anything yeah once it yeah cities is it's getting into a lot of stuff and it's %HESITATION it's it's it's crazy so I just mentioned you know there was that time during the campaign when you had on candidate Donald Trump and your thing was asking him if you can message here because so many people thought he actually is wearing a toupee and he said yes you can and you messed his hair and you got a lot of criticism for that for for for for kind of bringing him in on the joke and being nice to him as opposed to asking him tough question questions are doing like you know cutting us satire no mornings that lead to doing more political humor to no I mean I even when he when he was a candidate I made fun of his hair you know to his face I actually wore but his way again we've attended we did a sketch where we're in the mirror talking to each other no no I know I I guess are joining if if the if the criticisms led to doing well no I don't care what anyone says I think evidence I think there and I felt if I need people to write for my show I would have them right from Asia and that I'm not gonna change who I am because of them it's just the world changing I I I've had eight years of Obama so I did and never had this world yet so this is all learning for me I don't really know how to deal with this %HESITATION the presidency %HESITATION some kind of learning as I'm going I mean the hair messed thing %HESITATION you know I asked him as you know the questions that many questions as I you know as part hitting questions as I'm going to ask I asked him if he knew Vladimir Putin I asked him you know did you have any contact with him was the friends of them I mean I asked those questions it does get brought up because everyone just saw the hair thing the off can't levy messes here up in should I cool it wasn't like I don't know if that's a cool thing if I went up to investor Arabs that cool I don't know I thought it was more like a I've messed I touch the guys here that everyone wanted to touch them like everything is a real is it to pay we've always I've asked me do it for years and he's he went on all the other shows and he's been on every show I just figured I'd ask is if he can I mess it up music yeah he is just don't deserve to much could have some %HESITATION th speech I'm giving it a go okay but I'm like I might as well do it if I'm gonna go for it so just messes era you have to deal with a lot of tragedies and surprising events on a on the tonight show I mean you mentioned the shooting the massacre in Las Vegas on your approach to handling that was to say that it was a tragedy at night you're here to entertain and that you will and then you brought up Miley Cyrus to do this song and was it was %HESITATION a was Adam Sandler singing with her yeah Adam Sandler of all people came and played great guitar and sang beautiful harmony with there there was a choice that you made that you weren't going to talk about what happened you're gonna just offers some some beautiful music yeah I well I mean we really are here to entertain run every single night and it's a good does a lot of problems happening with the world in a lot of stress when you watch the news we follow the news on most channels see what's your local news to see what's going on in the world and that is our job to make fun of whatever we can make fun of and just make you kinda laughs so you as you doze off line of people falsely back after the monologue but says as he does off you're in a good mood to go home it's gonna be alright you know and I'm gonna be happy I'm gonna have Sweet Dreams and that's kind of my goal just so do you Michael is that you have Sweet Dreams and you go let Jimmy worry about the stuff hell have a joke on every single topic that and then we'll go to sleep and wake up tomorrow and we'll deal with today and at the end of a long day again he'll be there and entertain us and get my head the right space we found thank

anytime okay anybody Jimmy Fallon is the host of The Tonight Show his new children's book is called everything is mama yams and composer felonious monk was born a hundred years ago too is been the subject of many tribute albums this year jazz critic Kevin white had says monks fame is greater now than when he was alive Kevin has an appreciation as monks music is you a jazz musicians across the stylistics you might agree about what well these days we may forget is wine is ation is mostly posture after his death in nineteen eighty two everybody started playing this music and they still do while he was alive he had staunch champions who aired out is pretty and thorny compositions but there were skeptics all that plinking at the piano could he really plight months flat finger technique was homemade and he made a lot of discoveries adding that the ways of attacking the key yielding wheat timbres tricks of micro Tallman and precise fingering to for that year striking released two adjacent Keens just right you could sound like you're bending notes on piano as a stylist one is month learned a lot from old New York stride piano count Basie's with Connick blues playing Duke Ellington's percussive Japs and from the old blues pianist who mashed together two adjacent notes to stand in for the unreachable Blue Note that lay in between monk took that idea and ran with it made little clusters and narrow intervals cornerstone of his harmony he scrunched up chords sound both old bluesy an ultramodern as a composer monk wrote some fetching balance that singers later said words to and wrote more abstract lines for instrumentalists like a conventional songwriter follow up the main melody with a repeat and then a bridge a secondary theme in another key a conventional bridge has a contrasting melody but monks bridges might repeat or paraphrase part of the main theme to intensify its affect as mom put it inside of the tune should make the outside some this is well you needn't monk wrote a few tunes inside makes the outside a little Rooty Tooty the inside almost sounds like the outside turned inside out it also has one among some densest crunchy escorts one to stop piano students orient contemporaries typically improvised over to towards an ignored the melody monk wanted to hear the tunes his own solos often shoot close to the written line he took greater liberties as an accompanist we indulged his love of silences and open space I %HESITATION I %HESITATION vibraphonist Milt Jackson on most blues Misterioso sounding like he took the pianos advice don't listen to me I'm accompanying you his gonzo ways of backing a solo are more influential than ever one more way the rest of us are still catching up one last thing to know about mark spelling of his

S. not I US it's not Latin felonious ten letters with a second though you want to get that right now that he's a household name given what had right for point of departure and is the author of why Jack coming up Daniel Mendelssohn talks about his new memoir father who decided he wanted to take course Mendelssohn teachers on the Greek classic the Odyssey and let's just say it got a little awkward I'm Terry gross and this is fresh air weekend support for NPR and the following message come from Paramount Pictures and black bear pictures with the new film suburban con the film stars Matt Damon as a man who goes to great lengths to protect his family after a murder disrupts their quiet community variety says it will real U. N. and keep you hooked until the end also starring Julianne Moore and Oscar Isaac directed by George Clooney suburban con arrives in theaters October twenty seventh as Daniel Mendelssohn was preparing to teach a seminar at Bard College on Homer's epic the Odyssey he got a call from his eighty one year old father J. saying that he wanted to take Mendelssohn's class despite the fact that their relationship had not always been easy Mendelson agreed to let his father join the course but soon regretted it J. often disrupted the class expressing his dislike of the poem and its hero DCS and the challenge the professor his son but after the class ended Mendelssohn propose that he and his father take a cruise in the Mediterranean touring sites from the Odyssey on the cruise Mendelssohn saw a side of his father he rarely saw growing up a charming story teller who would delight the other passengers singing songs from his youth at the piano bar where was this man when Mendelssohn was growing up a few months after their trip his father suffered a fall breaking a bone in his pelvis the injury led to complications from which he would never recover Mendelssohn's new memoir is called an Odyssey a father a son and an epic along with being a classics scholar Daniel Mendelson is a contributor to The New Yorker and the New York review of books he spoke with fresh air producer Sam briga Dana medicine welcome back to fresh air thanks it's great to be here so your father out when he was eighty one called you up and asked if he could take your freshman seminar on the Odyssey that you teach at Bard College did you have any trepidations about letting him take it yeah excitement I certainly did I'm you know obviously it's very tied stand instantly I thought of this is going to be really interesting and strange and fun I'm I did have some trepidations because first year college students are not as practiced and sophisticated as upper class students students in their third and fourth year isn't it that you spend a lot of time sort of forging a bond with them and I was a little bit afraid that having might eighty one year old dad in the class was going to disrupt the dynamic and course this you know from reading the book that's all he did was disrupting dynamical though it turned out to be in a very in a very good way and in fact when we first discuss this I said well do you want it talk in this class you want to participate or do you just want to sit there and listen he said no no I'm just going to sit in a corner and listen I won't say a word lines and I Larry first that didn't have a very low very birth day of classes hands shot up and he started contesting virtually everything I said so how quite funny but it turned out to be remarkable and I think he really ended up making it so much better actually than it would have been I think if I was a professor and my father was gonna take my class I'd be really worried that my authority would be undermined by that yeah well look these are seventeen and eighteen year old kids and just by virtue of the fact that this strange man was my father you know certain particularly in their eyes because they're so young he had more thought could happen like it it was funny because as the semester went on I noticed more and more that you know say I would ask some leading question in class assent they would stop looking at me and their eyes would sort of slide over to see what my father how he was reacting you know so it was kind of interesting to have this other authority figure in the classroom I I don't it's also interesting that he he chose a position in terms of where he was seated in the class that seems to me sort of passive aggressive in terms of your position like he was sitting kinda behind here like behind your shoulder so whenever you had to talk to him you had to turn around to defer to him yes exactly we were you know this is that I've been class with a salmon are so not that many students and we're all sitting around a big rectangular table in life they're starting on the first day of class picked there were also some sort of scattered chairs in this room and he had a chair off to like my eight o'clock so these comments would sort fifteen of float in over my left shoulder and I would have to keep turning out I don't know if he did that consciously but it certainly was a way of kind of commandeering the spotlight and in some ways it was quite funny it sounds like Jim Ellison was not the easiest father to have %HESITATION you describe him as hard and he was all head he was not I'm overtly affectionate with his family and it sounds at it when you were a child you maybe you were a little afraid of him or at least unable to relate to him every time I talk about my dad I always start with the fact that he was a mathematician I mean that sort of structured his view of life and he loved precision and accuracy and facts %HESITATION and like the equations of life to work out %HESITATION that he was not an emotional person he was not a hugger he was not a kisser and you know I do want to give caught the wrong impression it was not some terrifying monster either my mother by contrast you know was very funny and very affectionate and so we grew up having the sort of two quite different models of parenting but he had also had a kind of a hardscrabble childhood he was born a week before depression began and he was very much a product of that and he was tough you know he's a very tough person is tough on himself out to give him credit and expected a lot from himself you know his parents my grandparents were both immigrants they'd never got past high school my father was very brilliant and he was largely self taught I mean he just sat around reading all the time and he demanded from us also a results good grades he pushed us very hard he was not happy if we didn't do well in school he wanted us to achieve so he was a kind of a tough not %HESITATION in many ways okay so the class begins the seminar you're teaching in the Odyssey and your dad has joined you and %HESITATION on the first day arm you think to yourself this is going to be a nightmare things do not begin as you hoped that your dad did not like the deceased as a character what were the issues that he had with well yeah I guess you're right it started on day one this is the first meeting of the class and I had via email asks the students to read book one of the Odyssey with sort of sets up the situation and to have interesting things to say about it and so I said so you know what do you think %HESITATION on the first day of class in my father's hand shot up and he said well I don't think or DESY is is a hero what's so Hiro Ueki lies all the time he's moping around this island weeping because he can't get home he's crying that drove my father absolutely bonkers that the hero this great Greek hero cries all the time he couldn't figure that one out and he said he cheats on his wife he's with this nymph calypso and they're messing around every night and why is this guy I suppose to be such a great hero and that was like the first hour and you know it was funny that with so and here again this is something I came to perceive over the course of the semester certainly not during that first class session but my father was that but because he had this let's call it mathematical view of life he couldn't bear Odissi is because I just yes to some extent represent everything that my father hated or diseases in nothing but grey area you know that's how he survives raise improvising all the time he improvises he lies he famously makes up stories his cunning he's cunning he does sleep with calypso hugs Circe and all these fabulous god is on its way back to his own true wife and I think %HESITATION that's just irritated my father he just did he not only did he disapproved of those things but he he was perplexed why this character is about to be so heroic there was a certain moment during the class well into the class when it finally hit me that one reason that he did not go to see his fat Odissi is reminded my father of his own father in law my grandfather my mother's father who is exactly a kind of %HESITATION deceased type and in fact in my earlier memoir the lost I wrote very extensively about my grandfather and the invariant Myron way precisely because he was all those things he was a survivor he was a rock on terror enough fabulist and a liar and dates tricks juror and he'd loved Wendling things out of people it's hard certain point one day halfway through the semester in my fought Mike my dad was in vain yet again in AB against %HESITATION diseases qualities in this light bulb went off on over my head and I just thought oh my god he doesn't like a deceased because he reminds them of grandpa yeah I'm basically but that's not to say that you know I don't think it was only that I or one could say also that eating like grandpa because he was like a disease you know it was just the type peed in understand so after the course and did you and your father went on a Grecian cruise this ten day trip that takes tourists to sites on from the Odyssey and this was your idea and it was on this cruise that you saw side of your father you he rarely saw %HESITATION and I'm one that you wished you'd seen maybe more as a child he he was this among the other passengers he was charismatic charm where he would you know tell passengers about stories from his life at the piano bar he would sing along from the great America but when you were shocked yeah it was the most sustained exposure I ever had to a side of my father that I knew existed but only sort of peeped out intermittently in my own experience he you know it's funny now that I think of it looking back you know he'd never like to take vacations but once he was on vacation and he he sort of relaxed into a different persona and and he was very charming you know it's funny because my father but you always think of him as sort of grumpy and some way and and he hated close you know I can understand why people like to get dressed up it always irritated him and you know here on this Mediterranean cruise and there would be dinners every night in but suddenly he sort of started enjoying all of this stuff and you know I've I work this experience into the book partly because as we know I mean it's it is sort of truism that travel is expanding I mean that's why we travel and that's why we go to different places of course the Odyssey is a text that's obsessed with travel and the transformative effects of travel because of course by the time I just use does get back to if the guy he is not the same person who left I mean that's just a fact of travel and of life and my father was so he was just charming outfit or there's no other word to use he was you know every night there was a sort of gaggle of people who would gather at the piano bar in the lands and that **** would play on my dad's favorite music from his era of the thirties and forties the great American songbook and quite often he would sort of sing along in his gruff voices and tell stories about his youth there was one night when somebody had been asking if we thought that the wizard of oz was that as I do see Ian text and we were sort of discussing that and suddenly my father launched into this reminiscence of seeing the wizard of oz in the last days of the summer of nineteen thirty nine with his dad my grandfather and his brother and you know and so he would just showed us side of himself that for whatever reason he wasn't comfortable showing all the time certainly not in our childhood and you know even later on this is a funny moment when you get on the boat %HESITATION the way your dad puts up this gonna put on this brown shirt and you actually throw fifth of whole cloth I threw it into the idea that you can't see it well you know as I said my dad did with not a dresser and I hope people on the first night of the cruise you know that with the kind of welcome cocktail party and and I'm in the state room with my dad and he's getting dressed in his putting on this brown polyester certain I said dad this is a Mediterranean cruise you just you know it's either blue or white or don't wear it you know and and is like what this was an expensive Sheraton I took this art night walk to the balcony and I threw it into the sea ice that I am not going to go to this but cocktail party with you looking like a front and he actually thought it was pretty funny once he got over the loss of this shirt but I do you know what's in and check that says something about him and his relationship close he just one item of clothing was very much the same as another as far as he was concerned so on the cruise you have a moment that relates back to %HESITATION when you came out of the closet to your parents on when you're in college men at the time your father said to your mother let me talk to my know something about this but you're right that you didn't want your coming out to be a basis for intimacy with their fathers he left the room before he could tell you but he tells you the story on the boat what was the story he told when I came out to my parents just in my junior year at the university of Virginia as I recall you know I'd worked myself into this frenzy now look you have to remember it was nineteen eighty it was a very different world than nice it's things are a lot easier now and so I had sort of work myself into this frenzy of anticipation and I started talking to my parents hadn't I must say to her credit my mother fell asleep I'm that's the gods truth my mom fell asleep at my father nudged her and he said don't you think you want to respond to this and he said oh Daniel for good boy I'm so it'll be fine %HESITATION but with just you know if I have any sanity it's probably because of that but my father I was very struck at the time and remember this is the time when I was not close to my father and rightly sort of uncomfortable at the idea of having a kind of closeness to him and then he said to me something else at that time I didn't really process and he said to my mother let me talk to him I know something about this and I never you know was such an emotional moment for me there's something it's going on that I never really thought through what that could have meant and then at a very crucial moment in the cruise he revealed to me why he thought he could talk to me all those many years ago when I had come out to him I want to give too much away %HESITATION but he had that more experience with this subject at night dreamed that he dead when I was twenty years old you know it was just one of the many surprising things about my father that I wished I had known earlier and you know he had known somebody when he was in high school in the Bronx who was gay which is not something I ever ever knew and he then told me a story about how he had found this out of what his reaction was and it was just so wonderful because it again showed this side of him you know match and my dad it's it's tough teenager in the Bronx in nineteen forty four nineteen forty five and there's some little gay boy in his high school I mean it will but I can't imagine what that poor guy went through but it was typical of my dad that he was actually very tender that towards his friend as it turned out your father died about five years ago on the when you look at yourself in the mirror or you see photos of yourself do you see him in you or do you recognize him and things here too and I know work whenever I clear my throat I sound exactly the hifi father did when it clears yeah I'd totally do and it's funny because when I was younger I looked a lot more like my mom that as I've gotten older I'm looking so much like my father it's uncanny but yeah I of course I think there are things you know that's the way I kind of screw up my features and in contempt when somebody says something that I think is just mushy and ill thought out and I realize I'm making that Daddy face in her but I find that very I find that very comforting and and I love this stuff even if I'm sort of echoing or mimicking some grumpy aspect of my father's character I like it because it's reassuring because you know at the end of the day he was my father and I'm a son well then you medicine thank you so much for coming on fresh air thank you it's great talking to you Daniel Mendelssohn spoke with fresh air producer Sam

to be re routed our daughter's school the affluent parents objected these are parents who are progressive they live in Brooklyn because they say that they believe in diversity often held up as being

year's recipients of its annual fellowship a generous cash award commonly referred to as the genius grant today's guest is one of those recipients she's Nicole Hanna Jones a staff writer for The New York Times magazine she covers what she sometimes describes as the segregation beat for the times and before that as a reporter for ProPublica she has investigated why schools remain segregated or have even become re segregate she's also written about housing segregation and how in the north it was partly engineered by local and federal government policies and she's written about how housing discrimination has led to a reinforced school segregation she recently wrote about why she chose to send her daughter to her neighborhood public school which is largely attended by low income black and Latino students Nicole Hanna Jones won a Peabody Award for her story on this American life about a school district in Missouri the most racially segregated school district in the state it's where Michael brown went to school eight days after his high school graduation Michael was killed by a police officer in Ferguson Terry gross spoken to call Hannah Jones earlier this year Nicole had a Jones welcome to fresh air so school segregation is an issue you've covered in investigated it's also an issue you have to confront as a parent you live in Bedford Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn which you describe as a low income heavily black rapidly gentrifying neighborhood of brownstones so what was the choice you were confronted with when it was time to send your daughter to school well as your listeners may or may not know New York City is I'm one of the top three most segregated cities in the country and its school system is among the most racially and economically segregated school systems large school systems in the entire country as well so wow as a reporter I have been cataloguing the harms of school segregation and kind of that then especially of integration I'm I had done that most my career not as a parent but as a journalist and then we moved to New York City my daughter's turning four and we have to decide where we're going to enroll her in schools I live in a segregated neighborhood schools in my neighborhood are extremely segregated I bought by poverty and by race and so my husband and I had to decide if we were going to enroll her in one of the school's types is because that I write about what we were going to use our privilege like many middle class parents and try to get her into a school that was last porn I think a gated so assuming that the school is assuming if you use your privilege you could of gotten your child into a school that had better scores and achievement and everything and more resources for students why did you choose to keep your daughter in the public school that had fewer resources I think for me it was a couple of things %HESITATION one I know enough about the research tish that I knew that my daughter would actually be fine in that school solved the research shows that higher income families who go into high poverty schools the education of their students their children does not suffer so I knew that %HESITATION but also really believed that it was important for me to live my values one of that the things I've done in my work is kind of show the hypocrisy %HESITATION progressive people who say they believe in equality but when it comes to their individual choices about where they're going to live and where they're going to send their children they may very different decisions and I just didn't want to do that I felt morally that was not the right thing to do and %HESITATION I also think it was that it is important to understand that the inequality we seem school segregation is both structural it is systemic but it's also upheld by individual choices as long as individual parents continue to make choices that only benefit their own children you can support equality as a principal all you want but we're not going to see a change and so for me it was a matter of needing to live my values %HESITATION and and not being someone who contributed to that a quality that I write about so the school that the public school that you send your daughter to her a lot of things you liked about that school including a lot of the teachers and things are going pretty well but then another elementary school PS eight which is less than a mile for for from the school your daughter was going to that other school was over crowded this school the overcrowded school was in an affluent neighborhood Brooklyn heights so head of the department of education deal with the overcrowding in the more affluent school so what's interesting is that school that we ultimately sent our daughter to is located and %HESITATION an area that had seen our brat bed demographic shift Anna had gone from an area that was fairly industrial and only had the only people that there were people who lived in public housing projects to a place where a lot of new housing had been dealt and most of the new housing the people living in the housing were white and they work very very affluent arm and so their neighborhood school is actually my daughter's school many of them but they weren't sending their children to their neighborhood school they were sending their children to that school I'm miles away PSA which had already turned into a majority white very about the school and because of that and because of how %HESITATION schools where that start to see a white population tend to attract large numbers of white parents that school was very overcrowded that school is considered the only option public option for people in the surrounding area so the department of education New York City after continuing to cram so many students into that building finally decided they weren't going to admit any more new students and they were going to expand our kindergarten for new incoming student instead those students were to come to yes there are seven which was my daughter's school so they weren't doing %HESITATION an intentional integration plan they really were doing dealing with severe overcrowding at one school and my daughter's school which is also very common being a poor black and Latino school bus severely under it rolled we have plenty of space so no worries nothing is ever that simple right so what was the reaction of parents were told they couldn't get their children into the more affluent school and they were going to be sent to the school your daughter wasn't well those parents were not happy at all %HESITATION they called their elected officials and they began holding meetings and they went to the press and really revolted against %HESITATION department of education's decision to send my children to that school I there were several pretty ugly meetings and at that time I was not sitting in these meetings as a journalist I had no intention of writing about this issue on I think it's important not to necessarily report a personal story on the beat that you cover so I was just sitting in these meetings as a parent who was interested to hear what people could potentially be coming to my daughter's school had to say about it on and it was it was her fault to hear that things that parents were saying particularly these are parents who are progressive they live in Brooklyn because they say that they believe in diversity %HESITATION often held up as being these kind of hipster people whom don't see race and I was hearing the same thing from those parents that I had heard in Tuscaloosa Alabama was no different he said that some of the things that were said at these meetings were hurtful to you what were some of those things well there was %HESITATION lots of questions and concerns about safety now keep in mind these are elementary school children these are there young kid and there were questions about you know they believe our school is dangerous they believe the children were dangerous %HESITATION it wasn't that they didn't want to go to school black kids it's just that these kids were poor and they don't want their children around so many poor children and they talked about the achievement of the students all our school does have very low test scores and so they believe that their kids will be dumb down if they came to school with our children there was not an acknowledgement that these children even part of the same community if them even though many of them lived across the street from the school and lived across the street from the housing projects that these children lived in so I think to hear her those concerns with no evidence the school is not a dangerous school %HESITATION there were rumors about you know guns just all kinds of things that clearly showed a racial fear and %HESITATION talking about our community our community as if these children and their families were not members of that community and I actually stood up at one of those meetings and as a trio seven parent and I told them the PSA parents if you don't want to come to our school that's fine but you don't have to slander the children in school because you don't want to come there sound you know make your objections known but I think that language and to think that the families at three of seven weren't hearing what the neighbors were saying about them %HESITATION was naive meaning people know it was very hurtful no you're right during this debate about what to do during the objections that were raised by the parents who didn't want to send their children to your child's school that %HESITATION each group white black middle class poor have their own concerns what were some of the other concerns that were expressed and what were your concerns so the concerns on the part of the parents that pistol seven my daughter's school was one of course there are a lot of bruised feelings when you have people who are talking so terribly about your children and and the education and what was happening in school for now supposedly coming to that school so parents really wanted a video we to facilitate some kind of coming together of these two communities so that %HESITATION they could talk through those things and that there wouldn't be tensions if those parents did come into the school but I think the biggest concern was there they a pattern in York city of once a scoreless targeted for white expansion that's cool very quickly flips and this is what happened at PSA the overcrowded school where %HESITATION the school that our target are typically very high functioning segregated schools so they're not they're not rezoning white children into failing segregated schools there Rick rezoning them into schools that are actually starving black and Latino children pretty well and then there's a fear that then those parents come men and they take over and that the little power that these marginalized communities have in their school they lose and ultimately on the black and Latino populations are pushed out of those schools so there wasn't a huge fear that this school that was doing a rare thing which was serving poor black and Latino children well what various very quickly not be their school any more and that those children would be sent away or crowded out of the school okay so this is a dilemma right here if integration is a goal to have more diversity and to have more fair schools and here is something that's going to integrated school not for the sake of integration but because of overcrowding but still it would be more integration and everybody has concerns everybody's worried about the outcome so what does that say about the predicament that parents and schools are in what I always say is we somehow want this to be easy and simple and it never will be on the systems that and the actions that created this inequality took a lot of effort and a lot of time and we want to undo them you know with no pain for anyone with a snap of the fingers on my Twitter account I say I cover rates from sixteen nineteen and sixteen nineteen is the year the first Africans were brought to what would become America as I to be enslaved I say that so that we understand there is a very forward or even a country we have created a system that was going to put black people on the bottom and we create a caste system and to undo that we we feel like no one has to give anything up or there's not gonna be any tensions or it's going to be easy and it and it simply won't I'm one of the things that I really tried to do with my work is show how racial segregation and racial inequality was intentionally created with a ton of resources from the federal government to the state to city government to private citizens we put so much effort into creating the segregation in animal and equality who were willing to put almost no effort in fixing it and that's the problem if you're just joining us my guest is Nicole Hanna Jones she writes about racial injustice for The New York Times magazine it's what you sometimes because the segregation beat we'll talk more after we take a short break this is fresh air uhhuh support for this podcast and the following message come from delta airlines committed to constantly improving every aspect of the travel experience including your ability to stay connected while in flight with free messaging on delta you have no reason to stop the conversations you're having on the ground when you get in the clouds so you have described your daughter's school as a as a high functioning kind of segregated of black school and most of the children in the school are low income so if everybody has to make a sacrifice of some sort benefits can be painful all the way around to really integrate the schools do you feel like you're making a sacrifice sending your daughter to this school because you're standing on the principle that you want to send your daughter to a public school and not not put your daughter into a more a school a school reserve for more privileged people do feel like you're sacrificing anything in and her life the quality of her education the %HESITATION at all the resources that you have in a in a better school yeah I'm you know I really grapple with this and in the piece I wrote and %HESITATION and quite honest about that arguments in conversations my husband and I had about this decision because I know better than most how segregated schools harm children that's why I write about in the way that I do %HESITATION but I think what what is important for us as citizens of this country to think about is what we see as the role of the public schools if we truly believe and the original mission of public schools and that they are to benefit all children and they are to you know it's not the market it's not private schools it is his understanding that no matter where you come from you will go into the doors of school and every child will receive the same education and no I'm not going to allow my daughter is not going to get an education and that she would get if I paid forty thousand dollars a year in private school tuition but that's kind of the whole point of of public schools I think she's on I know she's learning a lot I think it is making her a good citizen and I think it is teaching her %HESITATION that children who have less resources than her are not any less intelligent than her not any less worthy than her and I truly and and I say this it always feels weird when I say it as a parent because a lot of other parents look at you a little you know like you like your maybe not as good of a parent up I don't think she's deserving of more than other kids I just don't I think %HESITATION that we can't say this at the school was not good enough for my child and then sustain that system I I think that that's just morally wrong if it's not good enough for my child and why are we putting any children in our schools so I would say I have concerns I'm not everyday sure that I'm making the right decision for her am I being fair to my daughter %HESITATION but I think that I can provide my daughter anything that she's not going to get in a public school I love the money to pay for tutoring I take my daughter to museums I expose her to writers who come to my house all the time and it is important for us to be in that school because we are able then to provide some of that for classmates whose parents are not going to have writers and business owners and journalists in their homes so I think that that is what is so critical is do we really believe in the public part of public schools let me quote something you say near New York times piece about this year right true integration true equality requires a surrendering of advantage and when it comes to our own children that can feel almost unnatural so what's the feeling that unnatural feeling part of the equation for you jeep did you feel like it's unnatural to surrender the advantage so that your child has of course I mean I and work to get where I am so that I could provide things from my job that my parents couldn't and one of the the few advantages that my parents were able to provide for me was to enroll me in a busing program that got me out of my segregated schools and into high achieving more affluent white schools and I am not doing that for my own child so I I think it is the most natural thing in the world for parents to try to secure a bandage for their own children and to try to give up that advantage or tell people to give up that advantage is a hard ask I understand but at the same time I don't think that she is going to be harmed by this I think that it is only a sacrifice if you really believe that those kids are lasting yours and I don't think that that's charm with that said one of the main reasons I write so much about segregation is because we do know that our country's education system was built on a racial caste and that once we isolate %HESITATION black and Latino children and poor children away from white and middle class children we often don't give them the same resources they often don't have the same level of instruction they often don't have strong principles they often don't have the same technology I mean federal data shows that so my daughter's school is rare in that way and I think where that it does have better research resources than they diverge low income racially segregated school right but almost entirely because of of up a principal who with their name to reporter Davenport and when you look at these schools it is if they are high functioning it is almost always because of a single charismatic principle and that's just not a way to get systemic equality so I think that that is item the problem is school integration integration in neighborhoods is not about some feel that notion it really is about there's never been a moment in the history of this country where black people who have been isolated from white people have gotten the same resources not in schools not in communities and %HESITATION you know doctor king understood that in a visceral way that integration was about the sharing of power and was about full citizenship and and I believe that Nicole Hanna Jones speaking to Terry gross earlier this year she was just awarded a macarthur genius grant for her writing about segregation and racism in education and in housing after a break we'll continue their conversation and film critic Justin Chang will review the new NO a bomb back movie the Meyerowitz stories I'm David Bianculli and this is fresh air port for this NPR podcast in the following message come from Gillette the thousands of men and women at Gillette never stop working harder to make your shape better and now get blades for less visit Gillette dot com slash lower prices pricing applies to select products and is the sole discretion of the retailer so we were talking about how you've chosen to keep your daughter in a public school and not send her to a private school or so a school for gifted children your parents made the opposite decision when you were in first grade and you went to a school that you described as poor and distressingly chaotic your parents decided to take you out of that school and sign you up for a voluntary busing program that sent you to a different school what was the school you were sent to I was sent to Kingsley elementary and Waterloo Iowa and it was quite far from my home it was on almost entirely white very wealthy school after you became an adult and after you started covering school segregation did you ask your mother adult to adult why she decided to send you into that voluntary busing program to a more affluent white school I did you know it's funny %HESITATION at the time when I was a kid I didn't realize I was part of a busing program and I always say you know as a kid you delete your parents tell you to do in my parents told me to get on a bus and go to the school and that's what I did and it wasn't until I was much older and I started writing about school segregation myself that I realize that found what this program was designed to do and that my hometown had to enter into an agreement with the department of education too I do this voluntary desegregation program I didn't realize that I just knew that I used to be able to walk to school and then all of a sudden I was riding the bus for two hours a day so and I started reporting particularly this last story about my own daughter which was the first time that I'd really written about being in a busing program myself I did ask my mom why did you decide to do that %HESITATION because I have very mixed feelings about my own experience and I know from talking to a lot of other black folks my age who also went to busing programs that they also tend to have very mixed experiences because academically at it was transformative for me but it was very very difficult socially I'm so I did I talk to my mom when I was writing the story that published in June about kind of her decision making and why she picked this particular school which was kind of the farthest %HESITATION away from us and also probably the widest on and for her you know are my family's very working class my mom was a probation officer my dad drove a bus and %HESITATION this was an advantage that they could give us they both understood that my neighborhood school is not a high functioning and this was the one thing they could give us with a good education you said academically this school bussing program work free really well but socially it was very problematic what were the social problems you confronted well one %HESITATION not only were we black in a very wide school but we were working class in a very affluent school so I remember I mean things that stick out to me was all the white kids lived in the neighborhood they walk to school this was their school the black kids came every day on a bus and at the end of the day when all of our friends were playing in walking home in and hang around on the jungle gym we were having a hurry up and get loaded on a bus and and head back to our neighborhoods so it never felt like our school and I was bused from second grade all the way anti graduate high school and there were none of those schools that I went to that I felt were my schools because we were going to school in someone else's neighborhood you know it's like those schools belong to them on there is a particular incident when I was in middle school and at that time %HESITATION most of my friends were still white because there were hardly any black kids at the school and I was then talented and gifted so I hung out with a lot of the kids and counting gifted and in my hometown there's a quote unquote white side which was the west side and all the black people lived on the east side and we lived on the east side and and were bussed to the west side and over the sling Port Authority side of town and we still always go and play and they go swimming with my white friends at this one point their side of town and one day I suggested Hey why don't you all calm because women for my side of town and everyone was was down what they were all excited and then that Saturday morning %HESITATION about phone call after phone call from everyone of my friends was going to contact any they couldn't calm that their parents would let them come to the pull on my side of town but I was more than welcome to come to burns park which was where the bullet on their side of town and I just remember very clearly understanding what that was about %HESITATION that my white friends parents read our freighter didn't think this was good enough and so it was kind of constantly those types of things I didn't ever experience really blatant racism but it was always the things that that we're kind of telling you you didn't along you weren't got it out you read that the evidence shows that integration is really the only thing that improves the academic performance of low income other children of color to what is that evidence well you can look at %HESITATION test score data you can look that so those there's both so let me also be clear brown V. board of education never talks about test scores where hyper focused on test scores now and the way that we're confident ourselves with the segregation in schools is to say we're just going to get those schools test scores up to par well one we haven't done that %HESITATION but there are lots of measures of of what schools are supposed to do and you know when we found public schools in this country it's not to get kids to have good test scores thing to say that but %HESITATION what the data shows is we know if we're looking at test scores if we're measuring the achievement gap which is the test score gap between black and white students that gap was the narrowest at the peak of integration in the school integration which was nineteen eighty eight as soon as we start to see %HESITATION that segregation increasing again that achievement gap increases and we've actually never gotten back to that low point that we were at when schools were the most integrated but there's also are great science and out of Universitat for your Berkeley by a professor named record Johnson the shows a longitudinal facts a school desegregation on black students and what it showed is that it changed their entire trajectory of their lives that it wasn't just about how well they scored on a test that black students who went to integrated schools warrant less likely to be poor as adults will more likely to go to college %HESITATION they live longer they were healthier and they passed this benefit onto their own children and even within the same family if one child remained in segregated schools and one child went integrated schools the child in the same family who went integrated schools had the same lifelong affects if you're just joining us my guest is Nicole Hanna Jones she covers racial injustice for The New York Times magazine gonna take a short break we'll be right back this is fresh air mmhm pay its guy rise here host of the Ted radio hour and if you're looking for a new podcast check out the Ted radio hour every week we explore what it means to be human we go on a journey through the big ideas emotions insights and discoveries that fill all of us with wonder you can find it on the NPR one app or however you get your podcasts when writing about the schools you often use the word resegregation what does that mean so we have this period on after brown so just a quick history lesson brown V. board happens and kind of the way that we're taught myth about it is immediately our nation repented and do you know went into an integrated future together that's not what happened there was massive resistance we don't see rail desegregation occurring in this country and tell palm nineteen sixty four and really most rapidly from nineteen sixty eight on and then you see pretty rapid desegregation particularly in the south and %HESITATION but then that changes and in nineteen eighty eight we start to go backwards sol we reach kind at the peak of school of integrating of black students attending majority white schools at the highest rate that they ever have in the country and then we start to see school districts re segregating which means black students are are go starting to go to schools that are more more segregated in school districts that had had a degree of integration are losing that integration of why is that is that families moving out is that rezoning is it a combination of things it's a bunch of things %HESITATION particularly I think one of the big things was again most of the desegregation of cars in the south and it occurs in the south because the south was segregated by law and therefore are %HESITATION the way that the courts have kinda determined desegregation law you could you could get court orders to integrate it's been much more challenging to desegregate in the north and there is a lot of resistance to desegregation in the north so what happened is across the south %HESITATION beginning under the Reagan administration but really speeding up under a George W. bush was a release of %HESITATION minidisc school district from their federal desegregation orders which meant that as long as these districts once their court orders to integrate have been closed they can do whatever they want as long as they don't say they're doing it to discriminate so they can resound to create all black schools they can build all black schools on but as long as they don't say they're doing it to be discriminatory it's actually perfectly legal so that's a big part of it %HESITATION white flight out of cities what a huge part of it you had you know cities like New York and Philadelphia and Chicago that lost most of their white population and so in the north most school segregation is between school districts between our band I school district and the suburbs that surround it and %HESITATION so that contributed a lot to it as well you think it would just take for granted nowadays that there's black schools and white schools some schools are integrated lots of schools aren't there's black neighborhoods in white neighborhoods some in neighborhoods are integrated lots of neighborhoods are and and that's just the way it is absolutely when I %HESITATION started with what I kind of call the segregation beat about five years ago no one was writing really about segregation I think we had stopped talking about this as a problem %HESITATION if you look at no child left behind which comes out of %HESITATION the bush administration that was all about giving up on integration in schools and just saying we're going to make these poor black Latino schools equal to white schools by testing and accountability so no one was discussing integration anymore and I think it's because one we never really wanted it and if you look at about the great civil rights legislation that gets passed in the sixties the very last law that passes the fair housing act which gets passed in nineteen sixty eight that was considered the northern civil rights bill and that's why that was the toughest one sell the sixty four Civil Rights Act very successful it would be very surprising if I were to try to walk into a cafe or go on a bus and be turned away because of my race the voting rights act was considered extremely successful but the fair housing act is the one that's considered the complete failure because that was going to integrate where we live and by proxy that would integrate schools and northern congressman fought that the same way that southern congressmen were fighting and other civil rights off and the only reason that law gets passed is doctor king gets assassinated hundred cities riot %HESITATION black poor segregated northern cities and is in the flames out where they're literally are %HESITATION writers within feet of Capitol Hill that Congress manages to pass the fair housing act and then Nixon is elected and immediately runs on a strat southern strategy where he sat if you support me he's appealing to white southerners and white northern ethnics that he well stop forward progress in school segregation at school desegregation and housing integration and that's what he does soul we never as a country wanted this it's always had to be forced and as soon as our country lost in our elected officials in our courts lost the world aforesaid item most white Americans were just fine with that I think what's important understand is the north has has been able to portray the south as part of the country that has a race problem in a very comfortable with that so that the south enforced its racial cold through laws in the north race and racial called it racial equality was enforced through how thing so the north is the most segregated region of the country both for housing and for schools and the north is no better on race in the south it was just for most of the country the black population in the north was very small and as you start to see millions of black people migrating from the south starting in of the early nineteen hundreds suddenly the north is confronted with having to do with black people and it doesn't do any better than the south %HESITATION it creates ghettos it red lines it forces black people to stay in very small sectors of the city and so when you're looking at something like the fair housing act that is forcing northerners to deal with their race issue and northerners are not any more willing to do that than southerners work when you look at how integrated schools are down south and it is true is because a court order %HESITATION you would not see white children and it's rare to see white children in the north in schools that integrated not the problem is that there is that there is no there's no one who will be pushing for this

N. and keep you hooked until the end also starring Julianne Moore and Oscar Isaac directed by George Clooney suburban com arrives in theaters October twenty sat with films like the squid and the whale and Margot at the wedding among his credits the writer director Noah bomb back is no stranger to squirm inducing comedies about dysfunctional families his latest picture in this vein is the Meyerowitz stories new and selected a Netflix original film starring Adam Sandler Ben Stiller and Dustin Hoffman film critic Justin Chang has this review every once in awhile Adam Sandler shakes off all that pure rile idiocy and reminds you what a terrific actor he can be he went memorably deep and dark years ago in films like punch drunk love and funny people exploring caustic new depths of neurosis and insecurity by contrast he's in a wonderfully mellow mood and know about box and joyful new ensemble comedy the Meyer with stories new and selected Sandler plays Danny Meyerowitz a middle aged New Yorker whose newly separated from his wife and about to send his daughter Alisa played by grace van Patten off to college Eliza is an aspiring filmmaker to the delight of Danny's father Harold played by Dustin Hoffman sculptor who both bemoans and relishes his status as the only working artist in the family Harold whose career has never gone the respect and attention he thinks it deserves concedes that his three children once showed flickers of artistic promise Danny was a talented musician there's a lovely scene in which he and elisa play a self composed piano duet but he gave it up years ago and became a house husband is quietly dependable sister Jean played by Elizabeth Marvel was once interested in photography but now works in unglamorous job at Xerox and then there's the youngest Meyerowitz sibling Matthew played by Ben Stiller Harold son from his second marriage while Danny and Jean have stayed close to home faithfully taking care of their aging irascible father they're half brother Matthew lives with his wife and son in Los Angeles where he works in personal wealth management its success in independence our source of pride for Harold but of resentment for Danny who feels neglected and overshadowed by his little brother as its title suggests the Meyer with stories is a collection of shaggy loosely connected episodes that unfold in linear order each one offering revealing glimpse into the heart of a lively and fractious New York Jewish family in the first story Danny briefly moves in with Harold and his latest wife Maureen played by a pleasantly loopy Emma Thompson in the second story Matthew briefly comes to New York to meet with a client and takes Harold out to lunch so they can discuss arrangements for getting his affairs in order which means selling off his house and artwork the lunch does not go well the third story brings all the characters together when Harold is hospitalized with a long neglected head injury mere days before the opening of a career retrospective it's being mounted at Bard College in his honor it's an opportunity for Matthew and Danny to catch up on each other's lives but the competitive tensions and awkward misunderstandings that have long to find their brotherly relationship keep rising to the surface that's because you started your own company yeah a couple other guys in the house side tell your boss like I'm gonna start well and I was one of the partners so it integrity have a boss not I understand see you got a better offer no there were no offers that's what was so scary we were creating our own opportunity because you want something smaller bigger many of the firm's clients came with us with with surprise no we expect if we can't legally ask clients come in that they don't have much choice it's totally your choice no I know because you have their money well their money is with the firm that their monies and investments my buddy told me who lives across the street or lived across the street dad tell me about your carrying these like you you sorry %HESITATION also arbitrage yeah that's nominated the distant possibility that Harold might not make it provides natural occasion for years worth of Barry resentments to come to the surface followed by some tentative stabs at reconciliation it's all familiar dysfunctional family territory and bone back clearly isn't trying to reinvent the wheel here he doesn't have to he has mastered the art of overlapping dialogue of having his characters talk not so much to each other as at each other so we can pick up on every note of defensiveness and passive aggression his method here is to simply cram his characters into the same room and let his marvelous actors do the rest as played by Hoffman the demanding self absorbed Harold belongs in the canon of terrifically insufferable movie dads along with gene Hackman in the royal Tenenbaums and Jeff Daniels and bomb backs semi autobiographical drama the squid and the whale Stiller cuts through Matthews outer slickness to reveal this prodigal sons deep seated Daddy issues and Sandel is simply wonderful as the lovable but long suffering Danny his voice rising higher and higher as the minor with stories escalates toward a cathartic screwball climax a final word on Elizabeth Marvel an excellent character actress who spends much of the movie on the sidelines gene is the least developed of the three siblings which is partly by design she's the quiet unassuming stalwart in the family the one who is arguably suffered the most under Harold's neglect and also the one who complains about the least Brownback has made terrific movies about women in the past Francis Han mistress America both come to mind and while it's hard to begrudge him giving us three characters as richly drawn as the Meyerowitz men are I can't help but wish he'd given his female characters a bit more attention Justin Chang is a film critic of the Los Angeles Times on Monday's show new research

criminal profiling unit that's on fresh air Hey I'm telling the covers and embedded it's back president Donald Trump has no record of public service but he does have a record in business and on TV in our latest round of stories we introduce you to the people who were there as he built an empire and in the name listen on the NPR one apt or where ever you get your podcast my guest is Jimmy Fallon the host of The Tonight Show who was on the show once before when he was hosting late night this is the first time I've interviewed him since he took over the tonight show in twenty fourteen we're gonna talk about the tonight show and lots of other things but first we're going to talk about his new children's book everything is mama it's his second book for children just beginning to learn language each page as an illustration of a mother animal teaching her baby animal a new word the mother holds up an object and points to it and says what it is like shoe or waffle or balloon and a set of repeating the mother's words the baby animal response to each new word by saying mama on Tuesday the day the book was published kill o'neill came on the tonight show and read the book out loud with Jimmy Fallon on his lap nnova Julie hopefully god yeah we everything is momo according to you but they're all the former worlds no want to move to sun mama wall full my love hold my up I'm getting I'm getting tattoos mile mountain getting tired now and my server no ma ma the ticket Jimmy Fallon welcomed into the fresh air so that was a that was a moment so what was the process for you of deciding how to introduce your book on your show it's tricky because what my show would normally I'm there to sell other people's things %HESITATION that's kind of what I do or bring awareness to other people's things what's it's odd to have something that that I'm I'm Bob with to let people know that that's available so this whole thing is kind of a different experience for me and I and so I do it every now and then if someone brings it up for anything about kids books or some way that I can go oh yeah I have a kids book if you hadn't you are Shaquille o'neal's laughed while okay they wouldn't have had I didn't know he wanted me to have mine is lab I don't know no I I I knew that he %HESITATION was going to say something about the book isn't actually said like I want to mention something about dad dad or some because last time he said they enjoyed the data book or somethin sizes chair so I brought up the book mama not knowing that he wanted me to sit on his lap like of course you know how you want me to read this I want you come up over here and also you have to read this book to as I okay I don't know what to do because cities lift me up before he has I mean Shaquille o'neal is a very big man he can kind of do whatever he wants to me I once put his suit blazer on just to see what it would look like I met it was like observe wrapped in the like a queen bed like a sheet like a comforter was like the largest thing everybody had sleeves %HESITATION and it was amazing %HESITATION so when I walked over to us alright just good sit on my lap so I guess that all I get this site because I look like a little baby he's holding me and as I was laughing he's reading the book to me it is very me laugh so what why have you started writing children's books is it because you have children known you've been reading to them yeah it's fascinating they're getting to the age now there at four and two and a half where they're actually starting to the four year old started to memorize books and kind of de almost pretend like she is reading you know it's it's really a shame that I'm literally watching someone learn how to read in front of me and so we have it so many books in our house and she just goes everywhere and turns the page and tells what's happening in the scene points to words like like almost like if she knows how to read what she doesn't yet but I should so I figured that it be kind of fun to have a children's book just so I can say all of this is something Daddy Rhoden hopefully %HESITATION you know read with him which I did the idea of the first book I had a book called your baby's first word will be Dada and the idea was it was a joke that %HESITATION husbands and wives or you know %HESITATION have a thing of the unknown Spokane contest of what the baby's first word would be is gonna be mama's gonna be data so I would love the baby's first word be dead as just a selfish thing and so I would go all around the house our first child and I every time I saw or if I give her a bottle or give her food or change your diaper I would take you on a data plummeted that that is what you what his time for dad that I just kept saying we're dead hopefully you know to maybe fake the kid out so that she just keeps repeating the same the where dad that you know I at this point in care of the kid was unintelligent I figured that that you would learn later on but out so I did that did not work and so I I turns out I'm not a very accomplished child psychologist like I thought it was for about a father apparently or a bit like a very cruel fun itself idea but then they put out a book called your baby's first word will be data where it's just different animals doing animal sounds and then the baby animals are saying dad that back and I said if I read this %HESITATION was looking up to have a second child and I read this to the second child and it worked and the baby's first word was data are you reading books to children that were read to you when you were their age yes the exact books in fact I've saved my books from when I was a kid %HESITATION when my favorites is well there's a monster at the end of this book %HESITATION is the Grover book where he keeps warning you not to turn the page because he's afraid it's Sesame Street knees crying is like please don't turn the page but please visit the page like a you know there's a monster at the end of this book tortured building a wall sido it open you have to knock down the brick walls that I what were you doing this please don't turn the page again you know and then he's putting a rope on the thing and he's using a wooden he's hammering that don't and there's a monster at the end of this book when you do that you know and it turns at the end the monster is Grover yeah he is the monster at the end the booking us and you are so scared that course is just me into it says and I love the because it was funny it taught me bravery I guess that you know to behave I I just love the book my kids love it to this day I read them that all the time my question is you had a happy childhood you've said you had a happy childhood really did I know that what we offer comedian yes has been saved is out for a comedian so many comedians run on depression anger resentment and had like really difficult childhoods do you think that like your sense of humor was affected by the fact that you say you had a happy childhood yeah I mean I have to I mean to be really honest terrified press I went to therapy maybe something would be on earth %HESITATION but I don't think so I think I really did have a happy childhood how does a happy kid etcetera Jimmy if you go to therapy they'll honor things about your happiness to okay okay gets a little older so is something that is a win win okay yeah go get something in there yeah but remember we at those report card from kindergarten and %HESITATION the comment from the teacher was %HESITATION %HESITATION Jimmy smiles too much home which is very interesting what an odd thing to say about a child but I think like I wouldn't smile even when it's getting yelled at %HESITATION in our toll like Hey knock it off for will stop fooling around I would just like go okay I just always have happy kid you know do you think that being reasonably happy affected the kind of comedy you do you I think so yeah I mean I was very I don't know this prudish or you know I I very like a lot of my material I know I was at my parents seeing in my grandparents see my grandparents %HESITATION helped raise me you know they they lived in our backyard kind of like they had a cottage right behind our house and so I was I was hanging out my grandma my grandpa everyday you know they help they taught me how to drive and all that stuff growing up and %HESITATION I just would hang out with them and it was very kind of a clean comedian I never cursed her said anything risque and my and my acts just growing up I mean the older I've gotten I've kind of expanded a little bit more but %HESITATION my first couple ax was just very squeaky clean I think it's kind of a house out very happy that that's where I was I was raised because a it's a tricky I think it's harder to make a those jokes to make comedy funny if you don't have any profanity here anything dirty do you remember anything from those early performances yeah my goodness I mean I I I started out my mom heard about a contest on the radio an impression contest and she said %HESITATION yeah Jimmy should ensure this impression contest you have three minutes to do an impression and you do all these voices in your bedroom %HESITATION intagram like Hey you you can hear what I'm doing a lot better now that I'm like yeah but if we think that's it stop there I go but I go maybe I can do something and someone gave me a troll doll clothes graduating high school was price sixteen or seventeen at the time and they give me a troll doll with a graduation cap on is it like go graduate and %HESITATION those present I don't know what is gonna do with this thing %HESITATION but I took the hat off into the diploma of tonight use that in my three minute act and I said I would do different impersonations of people trying to be the spokesperson for the stroll down so I would say like a first up the auditions a Jerry Seinfeld I go okay people okay but what good does this guy crazy yeah or is on the line down move hope lies in the suburbs all you know and %HESITATION and then I go on next up %HESITATION peewee Herman like that I like to play these dolls I like a pair of my self doubt data and say in the %HESITATION I won this contest and so I was seventeen I think at the time and I did three minutes I did all that did probably twelve impressions %HESITATION and I won I want to say is like seven hundred dollars or something crazy and in three minutes that I'm never going home and letting that the money out of my kitchen table and we took a picture of it and this is when this before digital photos I mean we took a picture had to this is that you get is out you take twelve of them and pick the best one out so we have a photo like all this like cast on my kitchen table and me standing behind it like wow it is comedy this easy I mean I can just do that three minutes to get seven hundred dollars it that's amazing this is what I would do for the rest of my life and then it turns out that Congress not that easy like this is a rare thing you know it's funny the other time that you on our show before you were hosting The Tonight Show you talked about how when you auditioned for Lorne Michaels for Saturday Night Live you did the troll routine and %HESITATION they didn't hire you the hair tracing Oregon but they called you back for another addition and Lauren said but don't do the troll routine no she lost we've seen the troll doll then then we're fine with that move on let's do something else and that that's all I have LA half my whole leg of the work and the troll routine and at this point I was twenty three so all my experiences that I move to LA and I was you know working at the improv out there on Melrose %HESITATION Avenue and I yeah taking lessons at the Groundlings and taking acting lessons with Gordon hunt Helen hunt's dad which was not asleep Gordon hunt probably thought I was an idiot I wanted this acting class and this is like I was released studying like Buddha Haagen and all these things act like look at me right so I I go in and I was really into James Dean at the time I remember this and I was like and I go James Dean I read all his biographies he never acted in his acting class he just observed and I go home cool that is so James Nichols so I would go to his class I pay money which I didn't have but I pay money for this class and I would say not just wanna observe and I would sit in the back of the class is what's the acting class news like Jimmy sure I mean you should just get down here and I try I don't know couldn't get us gonna just gonna observe and he's like I I gotta be honest I really think you you're wasting your time but okay if you want to just sit back and and so I kind of just did that I didn't really act in the acting classes but it really paid off that puts you as you can see in my movie roles if I can in order to be James Dean because you're so different from James Dean I mean this series taken his romance always like holding so much in in his his this like you know like romantic figure of %HESITATION who's holding all the CNN until just like explodes out of him and %HESITATION he has this kind of like reserve an inner cool and your soul is seemingly like extroverted I love him I love river Phoenix I loved Leonardo DiCaprio they're like my favorite they're my favorite actors and I think we'll just because they just look so cool you know and they would do just were so cool in every scene I go I'd love to be able to do that of course people want to do what they're not good at I think it's just a thing that happens with actors or comedians or whoever it's like I remember after I got sat live for a little while I told my agency go I don't wanna do any movies that unless it's a western and they will chase you realize that you don't make western thinking we would be talking about I go I want to be like shot off horses on thing I just wanna be a cowboy I'm what don't do any movies unless it's a western and they're right I disguise that difficult man is like but why would I not want to do a comedy because that's a clearly what I am and what I'm best at but you know it's just those phase you have to go through I mean we all right so what what role did you see your W. the sheriff were you on the guy who's given of guns because like sterling Hayden and %HESITATION enter on the guitar you're right yeah but you don't have a gun but like you're so tough when you're so cool you're going to win no matter what anyway yeah I probably was the sidekick to the cool guy home where I still is kind of cool but I I in my head I saw myself getting shot off a horse which again is it when I go to therapy that something's gonna come but I know I've been excise of with a good fall I love falling I mean I still love Chevy Chase and growing up nice to practice following of fall down the stairs I would trip and knock things over on purpose you know I I'm real I'm still very good tripping and falling I would do Jerry Lewis and and Chevy Chase moves %HESITATION all the time I mean I've heard great Chevy Chase stories %HESITATION Lorna's told me they seems like a Chevy is so funny there we go to a restaurant so would be Lorne Belushi %HESITATION ill Lorraine Newman Gilda divvy out to dinner and Chevy go okay I'm a get up and I'm gonna trip and violence that waiter without the water and they %HESITATION Chevy please don't do this please don't because now I'm going to do that please don't because that they don't want a laugh knowing about selecting new these gonna do it and he would spend all time walk all the way around the restaurant and they come from a different angle than trip and then knock into away knock water glasses everywhere and they would try to sit there and try to not laugh like that it knows having Butler said it was the funniest thing ever and he would do it all the time okay we have to take a short break

find a job which is kind of hard sometimes %HESITATION but if you can you have to just tackle it so that at least you I I don't know %HESITATION kind of got that joke well you you kind of put that choke away go okay good now that's that and you made a joke about that bit image of what this paper every day this like five but it's I mean %HESITATION you know we come in our writers like I don't know where else we can go but now if he just in start another fight with somebody else and so or something else going on just getting it's just crazy so I think now we're more sixty political and forty fun poppy jokes you know the thing is even if you're not political president trump has been involving himself inserting himself in like every aspect of popular culture football his reviews of Saturday Night Live when he doesn't like an impression of him I mean he's just he's just is appearing in everything is like no getting away from from anything yeah wants it yeah cities is it's getting into a lot of stuff and it's %HESITATION it's it's it's crazy so I just mentioned you know there was that time during the campaign when you had on candidate Donald Trump and your thing was asking him if you can message here because so many people thought he actually is wearing a toupee and he said yes you can and you messed his hair and you got a lot of criticism for that for for for kind of bringing him in on the joke and being nice to him as opposed to asking him tough quest questions are doing like you know cutting us satire no mornings that lead to doing more political humor to no I mean I even when he when he was a candidate I made fun of his hair you know to his face I actually wore but his way again we've attended we did a sketch where we're in the mirror talking to each other no no I know I I guess are joining us if the if the criticisms led to doing well no I don't care what anyone says I think evidence I think they're not afraid if I need people to write for my show I would have them right from Asia and that I'm not gonna change who I am because of them it's just the world changing I I I've had eight years of Obama so I did and never had this world yet so this is all learning for me I don't really know how to deal with this %HESITATION the presidency %HESITATION some kind of learning as I'm going I mean the hair messed thing %HESITATION you know I asked him as you know the questions that many questions as I you know as for hard hitting questions as I'm going to ask I asked him if he knew Vladimir Putin I asked him you know did you have any contact with him was the friends of them I mean I asked those questions it does get brought up because everyone just saw the hair thing the off can't levy messes here up in should I cool it wasn't like I don't know if that's a cool thing if I went up to invest your Arabs that that cool I don't know I thought it was more like a I messed I touch the guys here that everyone wanted to touch them like everything is a real is it to pay we've always I've asked me do it for years and he's he went on all the other shows and he's been on every show I just figured I'd ask is that he can I messed up was like yeah he is just don't deserve to much could have some %HESITATION th speech I'm giving it a go okay but unlike I might as well do it when I go for it so just messes era you have to deal with a lot of tragedies and surprising events on on the tonight show I mean you mentioned the shooting the massacre in Las Vegas on your approach to handling that was to say that it is a tragedy at night you're here to entertain and that you will and then you brought up Miley Cyrus to to do this song and was it was %HESITATION a was Adam Sandler singing with her yeah Adam Sandler of all people came and played great guitar and sang beautiful harmony was there there was a choice that you made that you weren't going to talk about what happened you're gonna just offers some some beautiful music yeah I well I mean we

journey through big ideas emotions insights and discoveries that fill all of us with wonder you can find it on the NPR one app or however you get your pocket so I've been noticing like your finger recently had been in a bandage now it's in a kind of flesh colored band aid that you can or something like that you can hardly see but it's here to feel like yeah I'm I'm sorry you had you had a really horrible injury would you describe what happened to you so it it's called ring ring of Volscian and %HESITATION I would I wouldn't go that far it's pretty gross but what happened was I I've tripped and fell in my kitchen just running around and I put my hand on the counter top to catch my farm my wedding ring got caught on the day's sharp edge of my counter top and I fell down but my ring stayed up and tore the rain didn't move it on is really strong ring the rings in general I think are too strong it just ripped the whole end of my finger off tendons and everything and that and I I don't know what had happened and I just so blood coming out I go %HESITATION so just jumped in the eye threat to dish tower in my hand ran the cab and %HESITATION and and what's the mercy room and that that that that think I said I think I broke my finger in the go now you can break it just rang a Belgian we had to get like a special doctor and so I ended up that I want to thank all the doctors and nurses at at Bellevue I was in Bellevue for I see you for ten days Dr Chiu doctor David Chu was the microsurgery plastic surgeon that save my finger there were going to cut it off %HESITATION but it it's it's it's it's crazy so right now this was the second surgery %HESITATION this my last one %HESITATION but they put a tendon in there and %HESITATION from my for my wrist and they put membrane from my rib cage and %HESITATION they injected fat in the side of the fingers would look straighter %HESITATION which I took from the bottom of my hand which I was like Hey if you take fat out muscle go from right bell I mean I'm not a complete and utter complain if I wake up and I got six and six back out you know %HESITATION I go with whatever they took it out of my hand and said but %HESITATION so now I'm in the rehab phase I'm kind of like which is everyone tells you is that that is the ultimate that's we have to do when you get any surgery it's all about the rehab so really do that and so %HESITATION as weird as our talk right now I'm kind of just pressing on and just try to make a band again well also let people probably would have fainted when they saw their finger after what happened when your finger was gonna hanging on but you you just said it was me I'd like a I think like the dish towels probably dirty so if I wrap it around my hand and do you think about it if I thought maybe I shouldn't do that item scanning their paralyzed you know like I was also I am pretty go with like any disasters on edge kind of rolled the punches I mean the same finger I cut the tipoff %HESITATION maybe a year before excels making %HESITATION salsa yeah I don't know we know why I was making south side and I don't know if I'm gonna gourmets Saosin maker and even even care that much I love cells of around I need to make it myself and I %HESITATION pay items cut the tip off that really sharp knife %HESITATION also made me mad because south of the one thing that you can buy basically anywhere I must beg you to find the place doesn't sell salsa let's say your gas station you can get that but %HESITATION so anyways I'm just so mad at myself for doing that but I cut the tip of that same finger off and I had to go the hospital and have it re attached Penn had bandages on adopting a year two years before oaths nightmare me and I went through a phase where I was cutting my hands for like I went to the Harvard lampoon I was getting in the %HESITATION eh knows getting an honorary %HESITATION lampoon does %HESITATION under a member of that lampoon which means a lot to me and Love Harvard lampoon I have a respect so many great comedians and writers that came from there and %HESITATION I went out and I was probably around eight o'clock at night and the sun was starting to set and %HESITATION I just had had this injury happened the ring of us inside a bandage on my left hand so the Harvard that marching band came and surprise me and played a song for me so my buddy goes a Hey you know you should really thank those kids because they get paid for this they just did this like they've they've got the uniforms together was a really cool thing they did that and I hope I absolutely and saws outside there and I go Hey you know what maybe give me a bottle of jagermeister now present that to the band like Hey this is a gift for media to thank you guys if you have a vital inside I just try to be as silly fun cow it you know thing to to give them and so some I guess in a bottle of jagermeister and it's dark in this fireworks going are about to go off and I go to give it to the band I turn around and in the meantime some girl had gotten under knee to either propose to me or give me a flower and I turn around and she's there and I trip over her now again my left hand is completely bandaged from the ring of oz in my right hand is holding a giant glass bottle of own rooms and I'm like don't hit this girl in the head with the **** of me a bottle of it's glass glass so I jump over her and throw out the bottle and land on broken glass my right hand is now only the that's I had to go to the emergency room this is the ice would tear this alters story and I'm going to get a kidney this is the crazy but it was the oddest well it's not this month of my life that was %HESITATION right it was a ground to a July August it was right around when I just had this surgery for my %HESITATION from my other finger yeah I was honestly it was I'm so happy that phases over my life but I had to pick two really bad falls and like two weeks in a row they are now the interesting thing is one of your things this Prat falls like you'd you're saying you love falling down the stairs I'm budget I tested at all but you but it never fell with a great info really I know in blood but I'm like if I had my left hand I could have I know I don't know I just that may go just my brain was just thinking about too many things just like that but I museum of much better follow them that much more graceful so that all happen at like once and so now over this fingers getting is as good as it gets a can get I'm actually I'm certainly take piano lessons just to see if I can it's good for your fingers you know some I'm gonna see if I can kind of learn piano and see if I can get my finger back to working order I like the idea that something really good might come out of it like learning to play piano so you're in the ICU for ten days is that to make sure that your finger still a lot and it stayed alive Yahoo I go get like %HESITATION yet they're coming check on it every hour well no it had to keep it elevated and unlike his heat %HESITATION balloon almost that was a get a plastic heated bag that will go over my hand and I just keep the blood moving in flowing they had like an ultrasound would like it it almost like a like at ten that was an ultrasound pen and they would put it on the tip of my finger and if you heard that to talk that was a good sign them as your blood blood like three yeah removed so I was like it was just really an insane time a lot of a lot of alone time yeah so so ten days in the ICU what did you do to did you watch TV did you listen to music what what was your appetite for either being entertained or just absorbed in something other than yourself I I read a lot of %HESITATION I've read a lot of books I didn't watch so much TV because daytime TV for me was pretty depressing I did not enjoy it was like a lot of people a lot of judge shows are people suing each other and fighting house and not the mood for that I think this is terrible one late night come out while I don't I don't care if I watch you know I what's cool there came one god and I don't care who it is I need a laugh I need to watch something funny right now and and fresh but %HESITATION I member %HESITATION reading %HESITATION man's search for meaning by Arthur Frankel and who man a man that was one of the best books ever read %HESITATION and just if you think your life's tough check out that book and you go wow that's it's a lot of struggle there one musher question since you've been in the hospital even though you weren't able to watch late night in the hospital %HESITATION I guess no wifi either but anyways on yeah exactly yet so what when you're doing your show now do you ever think about people who were in the hospital or who are home recovering or who have some kind of like chronic illness playing that and that you want to be there for them all the time I absolutely think about all the time and that is the best thing about my show is that I know there's people out there who are going through a tough time and hurting and I get notes from them and I get social media from them and I know there's people in the ICU and there's people hostile that can't even send notes but I trust me I'm sending them the best five and I want them to just laugh and get through whatever they're going through and get out of there and go home get out of that hospital %HESITATION get well if you're sick get well I mean I really I meant to make people happy that's my job that's what I'm supposed to do I think on this on this earth and that's I'm gonna do whatever I can to make people happy Jimmy Fallon thank you so much for coming back to fresh air it's just been great to talk with you I love it I love hearing your voice I can would come back and I want to come back to the night show please please please anytime okay Hey buddy Jimmy Fallon is the host of The Tonight Show his new children's book is called everything is mama after we take a short break David Bianculli will review the new Netflix drama series mind hunter about the formation of the FBI criminal profiler this is fresh air support for this NPR podcast in the following message come from Gillette the thousands of men and women at Gillette never stop working harder to make your shape better and now give blades for less visit Gillette dot com slow lower price pricing applies to select products and is the sole discretion of the retailer Netflix has another drama series premiering tomorrow and it's one that has ties to house of cards streaming services first big original success story that series was executive produced and its first episodes directed by David Fincher the same is true of this new series which is called mind hunter our TV critic David Bianculli has this review producer director David Fincher is attracted for the most part to stories and characters that are dark and complex that's certainly true of mine hunter the new Netflix police drama series but his path to get there is pretty straightforward way back in nineteen ninety five Fincher directed seven the ultra spooky serial killer drama starring Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman who played detectives on the trail of a murderer played by Kevin Spacey then four years ago Fincher directed the first two episodes of Netflix's house of cards starring spacey who like Fincher also served as an executive producer and now Fincher the guy who helped make Netflix a respected player in original TV programming returns to the network with a new drama about the hunt for serial killers mine hunter begins in the late seventies it's adapted by Joe Penhall John E. Douglas is the real life FBI investigator who under another name is one of the two protagonists at the center of this TV drama Jonathan Groff who play Jesse on fox's glee is Holdin Ford a young FBI agent with bold new ideas about how to learn from imprisoned murderers by interviewing them hold McElhinney who played the boxer on FX's lights out and was also one of the boxers in Fincher's fight club movie is bill tench the veteran FBI instructor who thinks young hold and may be on to something but after holding tests his theory by visiting the so called coed killer in prison their FBI boss played by Carter Smith is furious and threatens to demote and even fire Holden until bill the veteran speaks up to defend him and his approach Sir permit me to speak I train holding because he was transferred to my department he knows his criminal psychology he's done his homework work just bought off and now I think he's on to something onto what he made friends with the co ed killer if any of this is gonna work we need to talk to more subject for no no what's next Charles Manson when he booked for we were thinking June I think it's right we need to use whatever resource resource my **** but what's the matter you bored with golf California jails are full of thrill killers and less murders and we put in there that's our job dying and riding on the phone cry me a river hold in all the wasted potential it is with the potential Sir it is because we could be using these people using how turn knowledge and insight of what themselves to self government over talking about we speak to other loan for you make him shut up I have not been able to do that Sir how do we get ahead of crazy this new approach to solving crime was novel in the seventies when the term serial killer had yet to be widely used but on TV fighting for a new way to catch killers is nothing new Discovery Channel did earlier this year by showing the institutional battles that had to be fought so that the Unabomber could be hunted in a new way in the mini series manhunt unabomb Netflix's minehunter is the same type of story there are crimes to be solved but the internal politics and policies are just as big a part of it and for mine hunter an even bigger part of it is when the FBI agents visit prisons and sit down for intimate chats with the captured killers the first time is when Holden visits Edmund Kemper the coed killer a soft spoken giant of a man played with unshakable creepiness by Cameron Britain the real life camper not only killed several people in succession but murder his own mother then continued to take out his rage on her corpse yet to Holden this chilling killer comes off as deceptively average until he doesn't I was a regular guy most of my life with a nice home nice suburb I had pets I went to a good school or which thoughtful educated well brought up young founded but at the same time I was living a file depraved entirely parallel filled with the based violence may have been fear and death check this seems to me like you had a their own unusual no unusual amount sure well I was gonna say signature when %HESITATION for a few will you could study it spell or drinking you know there's a lot more like me do you think so he was a killer in sequence like you do sequence while my after at regular intervals I had just been calling sequence killing mind hunter is the story of the formation of the FBI profiling unit and the mysteries are less about murder then about motive what drives the mass murderer in particular to commit such awful acts and can anything be done to predict and prevent them after events as recent as the mass shooting in Las Vegas these questions are almost painfully topical even though this drama is set in the seventies Holden the central character is almost entirely passive during the first two episodes he's less dynamic and has less memorable lines of dialogue than his partner his boss his new girlfriend a psychology graduate played by Hannah gross and certainly the first killer he gets to me but I don't think that's a knock on Jonathan Groff who was a scene stealer in Hamilton on Broadway is King George the third his character of Holden like minehunter itself is intended to reveal itself at a more deliberate pace one of the show's major stars Anna Torv from fringe doesn't even appear in the two episodes previewed for critics but Netflix already has renewed the series for a second season so minehunter can take its time the opening hours directed by Fincher are fascinating even while they're in no hurry to tell the origin story of the FBI profiler there are a couple of montage as in particular that are beautifully assembled showing the two agents on the road trying to teach their theories to local cops and detectives who for the most part are resistant to them but their new approach is precisely what makes minehunter so compelling most TV crime dramas are whodunit Columbo famously reversed things by starting with the murder and making it a how do you get him mind hunter in contrast to both of those approaches is all about motive it's so why don't David Bianculli teaches TV and film history at Rowan university his latest book the platinum age of television from I Love Lucy to the walking dead have TV became terrific is now out in paperback mind hunter begins tomorrow on Netflix fresh tears

A. where he's a successful money manager he's flown back to New York to arrange for the sale of his father's house an artwork but he hasn't told us half siblings when his half brother finds out about the plan to sell the house he's incensed here's Adam Sandler is Danny with Dustin Hoffman as his father and Emma Thompson as his father's fourth wife thinking about selling the house why it's very expensive to keep this place that we were spending more time at the country house now put the country's your thoughts before we were married but it sours everything if ours selling all the hundreds and why we don't have room for you to say well come on compare just grounded into a double play that set this up I told was a family discussion I think it is although you should sell it all comes only been expecting got so upset about I ask I am upset about it you can't I don't know we've lived here for years you haven't is where math you wouldn't some I always tradition is our you mean it like that she did some sort of about the same she feels like an outsider which is that kids of her own I teller technically user stepmother Noah Baumbach welcome to fresh air %HESITATION so I I love this movie and it's it's about what's so many families are like now different sets of parents and siblings and all the opportunities that presents from more resentments and maybe sometimes more love and I would say you're very sympathetic to all of the characters in this movie except maybe not so much the father looked at how would you describe his type of narcissistic personality in this is the character played by Dustin Hoffman who is an artist who has like the up most confidence that his work is great under recognized but great well I I think is the utmost confidence in a certain way but I think there's some aspect of him to that feels like a failure and I think in that way I do have a lot of sympathy for him and and love for that character because I think he is in a lot of pain he just can't access it the Dustin Hoffman character of the father he's a sculptor and a college teacher anything she is worthy of much more recognition than he's received his friend LJ has just had a museum show at the museum of modern art so the father kind of has to convince himself and everyone else that LJ isn't really all that talented because if LJ is that talented he's kind of like a threat to the Dustin Hoffman character at least that's how I see it so he starts telling his son you know ultimately OJ is a popular but unimportant artist just a disturbing commentary on the culture that truly ordinary work gets Reverend reviews by the critics I feel like you've heard that that if I was like borrowed that from things you've read fifteen hundred people say well it wasn't that Dustin I talked about when we we did that scene that you know because you know Harold goes to this opening of his friends you know and it's this mean big retrospective at the museum of modern art which bits of the pinnacle of you know or a pinnacle of you know it at that an artist's career and and you know Harold this feeling unseen and unrecognized and but actually all around him people are being you know LJ is very nice to him and trying to involve him include him in that in the you know when the festivities and introduces him to Sigourney weaver he has you know he's yeah but Harold really only knows how to feel slighted I think but yeah I'm due to your question I mean out that they're definitely a version of things I've heard this sort of notion that someone else needs to be lesser than so you can feel better you don't item and Harold looking I'm definitely lives and not and that kind of mindset so there's one more scene I wanna play and %HESITATION this is the scene between the two brothers who are on the board of the sons of different marriages they have the same father they have different mothers they live on different coasts they don't see each other very much and %HESITATION they're back two gether again uniting around their father who has been in the hospital so they're catching up on each other's lives and then so in this scene %HESITATION Danny who's played by Adam Sandler and Matthews played by Ben Stiller are going up the elevator in the hospital catching up with each other that's because you started your own company yeah a couple other guys in the house I would just tell your boss like I'm gonna start well and I was one of the partners so it integrity have a boss not I step two you got a better offer no there were no offers that's what was so scary we were creating our own opportunity because you want something smaller bigger many of the firm's clients came with us which was surprising no we expect if we can't legally ask clients come in there but they don't have much choice it's totally your choice no I know because you have their money well their money is with the firm that their money is and investments on my buddy told me to lives across the street or lived across the street dad tell me about your carrying these like you saris and %HESITATION also arbitrage yeah that's nominated %HESITATION the movie strikes me as being very %HESITATION carefully written every moment seems to count it doesn't seem like there's much improvisation Anna it seems very plan in a glad to hear you say that yes proposed in a good way %HESITATION yeah so what's it like to have somebody like to have people like Adam Sandler and Ben Stiller on the set and not and discourage improvisation what fool would do that %HESITATION well of versed photos with same glad that your observation because I I think pretty much every culinary I get asked how much improvisation was in the movie and I can't help but feel somewhat insulted by it because I think I I've been working very hard on these things and and they are very planned and very structured %HESITATION there's something Dustin was very articulate about I think we even kind of even help me understand got what I was doing and what I've been doing it in a more explicit way because he he would talk about how stylized the writing is but that when it's done right it doesn't actually feel that way it feels maybe more naturalistic but actually it's all rhythmic and and very specific as you say and and and that's true also of the blocking in the movie and and the camera work and %HESITATION you know and it it's all you know but I think of them as very stylized and constructed in a certain way but when actors come now ought to work on my movies I think they'll kind of know what they're in for so they you know nobody is like trying to slip in new lines and things they're all prepared extensively in and I want to do you know what what's on the page so since this movie is so much about the children of divorce and of half siblings from two separate marriages when your parents divorced today marry other people and have children with those other spouses they don't have children but they both they both married again what if your parents became different people when they were no longer a couple because I think most people change depending on who they're with I think most people have their you know like %HESITATION I am it like coach I think most people have some kind personality code switching is in addition to maybe language code switching where you're funny with one person in your more serious with another and you know you talk more with one person unless with another person you know you you more quiet and introverted with one person than another so did like did your parents change when they he came couples with different people and did you change when you you became part of those two different units yeah I'm sure they did and and and I mean I I observed it and I'm sure they did in ways that at that time I I didn't even see I mean I remember like the first Christmas after they separated and both of them got these big bushy trees and we always had these really bony trees and data I'm a brit thinking like what why didn't we do this when we all live together when and why why why now to have the good tree %HESITATION which is maybe I'm more of a symbolic version of what you're saying yeah do you think that watching your parents divorce and remarriage is %HESITATION need you any more or less enthusiastic about the prospect of becoming a parent yourself I've thought about that amend and also I'm divorced now and my my self palm they do not consciously I'd say now actually but you know I think it it has to have affected things I didn't really a member people asking me that because like I got married around the time that's when the whale came out and people sang ho how ironic you know that maybe then quit phrase it that way to me but they were thinking fondly of that unite Europe you've just taken this leap and yet you're telling the story of of of of of marriage falling apart and I I you know it didn't seem strange to me at the time I wanted to get married hello I'm so when you did divorce and it wasn't long after son was born did you feel like %HESITATION how can I do this to my son it like my parents did this to me how can I do to mess up yeah but you know it it's such a bad timing you dis own I just you know I just felt bad all over him and I I didn't even feel it that kind of dramatically like Ono I've done the same I you know I just felt like I wish this wasn't happening you know so let's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guess is NO a bomb back and his new film is called the Meyerowitz

the same information and it might be passive aggressive and that that just that sort of frustration of trying to deal with all of these complicated emotions in a in an institution like a hospital in when I was after I made the screen the whale in those high met Mike Nichols and he I said who is one of the better compliments of cotton in my career but he said that it reminded me of what why I got into movies in the first place which is revenge and %HESITATION and %HESITATION you know in a way I I I think you could say in some way particularly it was my not revenge on an individual but my revenge ana ana on a time in my life it's one of the issues for the sounds is it is it like is it okay to leave for awhile let no one like the Ben Stiller carrot right right says to them or so like I have a meeting with a client is it okay for me to leave it for him like asking the nurse for for permission but I've been in that situation with my parents and like you don't know if it's okay Italy first of all you feel guilty about just even walking out of the room and second of all if you don't know but is there going to be drama if I leave for an hour or two %HESITATION even longer like are they gonna still be alive is there something that terrible that's gonna happen or we have a transition point like what's what's going on but then the nurse or the doctor looks do you like like that's your choice you know yeah yeah that well I was it thinking in a way that the hospitals sort of takes the place of her **** parental role in a way for them because it it is like it in you know an absence of having apparently they are you you're looking at all these other people to tell you it's okay and you know what should I do %HESITATION you know you you don't know what the protocol is of the processes and you know it the same time your you know I think there's almost a sort of like for some people it's like they get angry and confrontational and for other people they get kind of like overly polite you know and sort of like they don't want to say the wrong thing for fear of some kind of retribution or something you know that that %HESITATION absolute like if you're the model relative than right and right me neither though treat like your loved one like extra nice or at least not right have you know who run because exactly how you know in all honesty there so much like sloppiness and and hospitals it can be really frightening you know whether it's getting the wrong medicine are not getting the medicine or just regarding certain symptoms that like you see you see this change but no one else seems to have noticed it and you have to point it out and then pointed out such a way so that like you're being nice about it you're not challenging their professional credentials by saying look they were better yesterday in the worst today something's wrong right is there a bit which which happens in the movie of that that that thing of you realize you know more than they do in some cases and and that's a scary thought you know because you can't make them better I I there's a great doctor and was on my mother in law was in the hospital he said like you know her really well what do you see that's different I thought like well it's really great yeah that's asked us and not just like how US he was he was really terrific that's what you wanna hear yeah I mean I know it's it's true of the hospitals it's true of the legal system you know going back to your same at divorce you know of these times in your life where you're at your most %HESITATION frayed and afraid then there's also the thing when it's apparent as it is in the movie seeing a parent who had been this very powerful figure when they were younger and when you were younger now be in a hospital bed and to be like an older weaker person in a hospital bed it's it's some it's Sucha a turning point in your relationship with your parents when you see them and that kind of condition and I think the the adult siblings in the movie are going through that %HESITATION is that something that you went through to with whoever it was that was in the hospital of seeing them in a different way because they were in a weak and vulnerable state from which they might never return to who they were before yeah absolutely and you still have here in the case of a parent you still have all the you know complicated feelings you know of of love then but also whatever else and you know with the the strong formidable figure that went in and they're all put on hold you know because they're in this this other state what you know and and I you know in the movie Harold is also such a verbal character and you know and he's actually in the hospital can't speak the same way minutes the sort of like aphasia or whatever he has there and he Ben's character Matheus dislike highly verbal fight with them which ends and screaming out of and then you know in the next sequences you know it is bad side and the father's being gentle and we can articulate and that's you know I've sort of trying to play out that just what you're saying there and I also thought about in movies too I mean this will give stuff away we connects welcome turn down the volume for a second but I think it's worth pointing out I think in movies death often is a catharsis in a movie that it isn't necessarily in life %HESITATION and I thought well what if the parent doesn't die you know it in a way doesn't that highlight sort of something else switches you went through this whole experience and then they're back out and they're the same as they were when they went in exactly and you're back to dealing with the same resentments again like you you did all the forgiveness thing you made your peace with everything then the person recovers father recovers and like your back to the same annoyances and resentments and like nothing's changed yeah I absolutely and and and that to me I thought dramatically and for the movie highlighted kind of what I wanted to be about which is that you can't but this is the stuff you've internalized of that your parents are in you now so you've got it now you know you have to deal with this on your own here now and they may be there may not be there %HESITATION but it you know this is up to you to to you know you've got a handle it yourself my guess is NO a bomb

that his unrecognized he's such a recognizable %HESITATION father figure of did you base it on anybody in your life and is that an uncomfortable question to answer well Mike my grandfather who was named Harold %HESITATION %HESITATION like Dustin Hoffman's character like dust off his character was a painter and we used to go to this is back where you could be a painter and teacher and have a townhouse in Brooklyn heights and but we would go to their home run Henry street and he would take us up to his psalm studio and he would put up the new work for us to see and no he would say things like I think this one's a masterpiece and then you know we would all nod and Alan and I remember feeling very intimidated by because I couldn't understand you know he was panning abstractly at that point and I couldn't understand it as a kid but I heard all about you know stories of him and you know his posted you know it was going to break with Milton Avery and Roscoe and there were all these sort of reasons given why he wasn't kind of on their level and a success wise and it was his sort of Iraq's ability his you know he was known for taking work down off walls if people didn't know gallery walls and people didn't appreciate it correctly here %HESITATION he died when I was a might twenties and he had like a show at Brooklyn College that we all went to when I was in my twenties and so I did a lot of that kind of I guess was was inspired by him did your grandfather pay attention to you yes but I am I think it was clearly on his terms you know who I mean it was was it your job to admire him I think E. I kind of knew that intuitively but I I posed for months you know like I wanted to get my painting done a member that was something that meant a lot to me because other people the family gotten their portraits but by the time I was doing it he was there again things were much more abstract and I felt like I wanted mine to look like me and it didn't %HESITATION words he'd done portraits earlier in his career that kind of looked like now there are more realistic and mine looks like a I'm kind of ghosts are some you grew up in park slope and the home that you grew up in was also used as the home in the movie heartburn which has a screenplay by Nora Ephron and it's based on her divorce from %HESITATION I wanna say Dustin Hoffman yeah %HESITATION Karl burns cover instant yes %HESITATION pick plays cupboard funeral the president's men and hurt you Nora Ephron's actual divorce was from Carl Bernstein's that's hilarious did you feel six degrees of separation from Dustin Hoffman voice it before you started working with him well I mean I had great love for Dustin Hoffman before I knew when because of you know all the movies I'd seen him in a minute he it felt very much part of my childhood yeah but Mike Nichols directed Harper who I got to know and become friends with witches great served so I did have that sort of flight connection it also was a movie that sort of had like so much talent and it was like it was Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson and Catherine o'hara and Stockard Channing and then also like Milos Forman was in it and industrial men droughts was the cinematographer who I shot all these great French new wave movies I later with love and so when I look back on like all those people who were in our kitchen it was kind of amazing so did you learn anything about filmmaking when heartburn was shot in your home where you on sat did Mike Nichols let you watch what was happening how old I am I think I was like sixteen something on %HESITATION in that well one thing that happened was there was a the hurricane came that weekend or release was gonna come I think it was it was downgraded eventually but they couldn't shoot they're supposed to only be and in our house for a few days but then they had to break down and and wait so all them my quit meant was left in our home including that the hot set which had a dislike lobster and stuff on %HESITATION and so we kind of lived for a few days ago in and around the movie while we waited out this her cane and but you know I don't know that I consciously did except like I it was the only time I'd ever been on a film set until I made my first movie so when I did make kicking and screaming which is my first movie I was twenty four when I made up bomb that was like what I thought well I remember this from this said that from Harper and I remember the PA's like or how the E. D. Tochter how %HESITATION you've sort of been my only now instruction manual for now with that this sort of protocol of a movie set why was it your house that was chosen it was totally random the it was also a double for a Washington DC home and we did it at the time it was like being cast in the movie I thought I was so excited about it and I really couldn't believe it I couldn't believe because movies in awhile I loved movies and I went to movies all the time my parents love movies we all talked about movies all the time but making movies was not that we don't know anybody who did it and I know inside knowledge of movies or how they got made or anything and so it really seemed like this kind of dream come true that this movie will be made in my in my home %HESITATION you know now the idea of a movie crew coming into my home sounds horrible com what I would do everything to avoid it but then it was like you know it really did feel like we were cast somehow we're not like somehow we've got to be in a movie when all Bombeck thank you so much for talking with us thank you Noah Baumbach wrote and directed the new film the Meyerowitz stories new and selected it opens in select theaters and will be available on Netflix starting Friday after we take a short break we'll talk about the making of the classic film Casablanca with no Eisenberg the author of a book about the making of the film this is fresh air mmhm pay its guy rise here host of the Ted radio hour and if you're looking for a new podcast check out the Ted radio hour every week we explore what it means to be human we go onager big ideas emotion sites and every fill all of us with wonder find it on the NPR one app or however you get your pocket next month marks the seventy fifth anniversary of the opening of the movie Casablanca my guess no Eisenberg is the author of the book will always have Casablanca the life legend an afterlife of Hollywood's most beloved movie I figure a lot of our listeners probably know the movie by heart but others may have never seen it so here's the basic story it's set in nineteen forty one during World War two the Nazis have occupied France Europeans fleeing them have made their way to the Moroccan city of Casablanca seeking temporary refuge in a way of getting safe passage to the U. S. because a black at that time was a French protectorate but now that the Nazis have taken over France they're starting to take control of Casablanca I'm free Bogart plays an American who runs a bar in Casablanca called Rick's he claims to pride himself a never taking sides one night a beautiful woman played by Ingrid Bergman walks into Rick's and realizes the owner is the same Rick with whom she had a passionate affair in Paris but now she's married to a check freedom fighter who is essential to the underground fighting the Nazis he's a hunted man and he needs her still loves wreck Casablanca is one of the great love stories and also a great story about knowing when it's time to take a side and risk your life for a cause the film starts with this voice over narration well the coming of the second World War many eyes and imprisoned your up to and hopefully log desperately fought the freedom not everybody Lisbon directly select talk shows roundabout refugee trailer sprang up Paris tomorrow say cross the Iranian galore and and by or auto political the rim of the Blanka Morocco and the fortune through or influence on luck might obtain exit essays and Barry Diller from Lisbon and you were the others and we wait wait so that's the opening narration from Casablanca no Eisenberg welcome to did we just here doing the narration so that was Lou Marcel who did some voiceover work at Warners in the nineteen forties it he Joe Clayton life that was just a fifty dollar job %HESITATION doing that that voice of but it's so important that that folksy kind of March of time news real style %HESITATION narration it really does set the tone and how Wallace really wanted the focus to be on that map %HESITATION on the globe rather and and and the focus on the globe is is really important I think to understand the urgency of the refugee crisis that so this really was a kind of refugee trail right from from France to northern Africa to Lisbon to the U. S. correct and that's that's all really quite accurately despite having been you know made on the sound stages in Burbank California made on the sound stage at Warner brothers %HESITATION and and you know with just one location shot that when when when Strauss is a plane arrives that was filmed at the van Nuys airport but apart from that it's on the sound stage at Warner brothers despite that it really succeeds in conjuring up not only that north African outpost but also succeeds I think in in depicting a history as it was unfolding and doing it really quite accurately so although Casablanca is written by Jews there's a lot of Jewish emigres in the movie people who have fled **** Germany and it's about people who are resisting the Nazis nevertheless the were Jewish the word Jew though at the at the Georgia that are never spoken in the film do you have any idea why here it's it's it's a wonderful question Terry arm mainly the the answer to that would be that the studios themselves with reluctant and and Warner brothers had so Jack what Harry Harry Warner who is the head of %HESITATION of the studio was a very %HESITATION it had a very strong moral backbone bone and he was very committed to doing that anti **** pictures are already are quite early on we had a they had a game here and yet they eat together with his brother Jack %HESITATION if they were concerned I think about having anything that would would draw attention to the not only the Jewish players %HESITATION in front of a camera but also those behind the camera and those at the studio I think they were very very reluctant to to rock the boat on that score and so if you think for instance of the of the Bulgarian refugees in so so Jack Warner's step step that a joint page playing with Helmut done teen an Austrian other Austrian refugee act fled the **** regime %HESITATION they're they're fleeing Bulgaria and they're fleeing %HESITATION you know the the the **** at regimes incursion into into into their into their own nation but it's not specified that they fling because they're Jews I am and that's that's true of all these other %HESITATION generic refugees who are depicted on screen %HESITATION and now in reality so many of them had fled the **** regime because they were Jews let's get to one of the romantic scenes from the film on this is a scene in which %HESITATION Bogart is thinking back to his time before the German invasion of France when he and Ingrid Bergman or falling in love and she was a mysterious character to him she wouldn't reveal much about who she was and that they know the Germans are about to invade the just a few hours away and so Bergman and Bogart a kissing passionately in this is the scene in which she says kiss me as if it were the last time one of the really famous lines from the film let's hear that scene you so much and I had this morsel or crazy world and think and have you shouldn't get the weight I mean if if something should part wherever they put you and wherever I'd be I'm going to this message more than lust I really famous scene you write that that line that famous line it's me as if it were the last time was originally written as Hitler or no Hitler kissed me %HESITATION so who wrote the original Hitler or are not alert Hitler line kiss me and who changed it to %HESITATION because music for the last time do we know yet this this requires a bit of conjecture on my part but I think I have a strong enough sense I think the original line was in fact Epting twins what happened with the with the the flash back though Terry is that how Wallace was a big concern team Jack Warner together and and they brought the director Michael Curtiz in on the conversation as well but they were concerned that that that that romance was sagging a bit because it just there wasn't enough there and so they brought in additional writer noncredit writer Casey Robinson and Casey rabbits in a just furnish the that Warner brothers had the screenplay for for now Voyager a year before that the Betty Davis Paul Henreid picture and and so that that that nine minutes a flashback is nowhere to be found in in everybody comes to Rick's at risk entirely new but I think the line you cited there is more or less attributed to the absent wins whether Howard Koch at hand it's unclear but I think what was re written is is is was done by Casey Robinson was done by that that that that that screen writer really quite well known for writing blustery melodramas blustery romances %HESITATION and and that's what you provided on he did so anything on credit capacity in late life there a couple of interviews we can kick himself for not seeking a credit but so it goes I think it's quite typical in Hollywood we have a lot of writers involved in something it only when it does very very well do they all customers for credit if you're just joining us my guess is no Eisenberg and he's the author of the book will always have

had to be married of course if this if there were was sex and had to be implied it couldn't be shown %HESITATION bad deeds had to be punished %HESITATION so one of the things that they had to deal with was the fact that of the French prefect captain Renault basically traded sex for visas leg of a young attractive woman would sleep with him she'd get a visa and would be able to get out of Casablanca and make her way toward America %HESITATION if they couldn't exactly say that in the movie so I have all had to be kind of implied and there's a scene on the Bulgarian immigrant who's asking Rick basically if she trade sex for a visa with the police prefect is that okay what if she never tells her husband what her husband understand so I wanna play that scene John and I we we do not want our children to grow up and so you decided to go to America yes but we have not much money and traveling is so expensive and difficult it was much more than we thought to get here and then kept to endorse he says and he is so kind he wants to helplessness Albert he tells me give us an exit visa but we have no money because you know that yes and if they're willing to give you a visa post and you want to know how to keep his word he always has you were someone left to very much so that your happiness was the only thing that you walked in the Warcraft she did a bad thing makes her death could you forgive her nobody ever Love Me that much and he never knew the girl kept this bad thing locked in a hot that would be alright wouldn't you want my advice obvious please go back to Bulgaria okay so is it did that seem to have to be re written a lot so that I could pass the sensors and be used if they have to do a lot of work for going out what language can we used to imply that she's asking wreck about trading sex for a visa without coming out and saying it yeah in the three accept what I will say is that that the captain Reynaud his his lecherous habits are much much more %HESITATION developed and they're under age when in fact their number places were really really kind of bears down on the script and what needs to be done this is true as well in the famous final scene of the film on that tarmac when Rick insists that she board that plane with Laszlo she being ill see here that you board the plane was Laszlo and and and for her to stay with with with Rick would be tantamount again too condoning adultery she still married to him so that the censorship code would not have allowed that no no no no that's it and it worked well with with the with the final scene not only to work well for the for that for the main censorship body the production code administration but also for the other censorship body at that time after America entered the war which is the office of war information that want to see to it that all films creating Hollywood on some level or another %HESITATION supported the allied war effort and and and and if the film does that as well by having a go off with with that with Laszlo by having goes to go off at last I would help them in that important work that he's doing is the leader of of the underground movement let's hear that inspiring ending were Rick it is it is using stirring words to convince else so that she has to go with her husband because her husband needs her to do his war work and if she stayed she'd if you stayed with Richie would just regret it so here's that famous scene on the tarmac when Rick is forcing Elsa to fly to Lisbon and then to America to freedom with her husband nnova said I was to do the thinking for both of us well I've done a lot of it since then that all adds up to one thing you're getting on that plane with Victor playable on direct that no one I've got to listen chances are and we both wind up in a concentration is not totally I'm trade register so would insist they're saying this on it to make me go I'm saying it because true inside of us we both know you belong with Victor part of his work the thing that keeps him going my plane leaves the ground you're not with them you regretted maybe not today maybe not tomorrow but soon and for the rest of your life what about we'll always have Paris we didn't have we lost to them can the Kassebaum got it back I would never you never will I got a job to do to well I'm going you can't follow what I've got to do you can't be any part of because I'm not good at being noble it doesn't take much to problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans and crazy way someday you'll understand that is looking those words are so famous may be maybe not tomorrow tomorrow %HESITATION any insights into that scene you want to show about how it was written well I mean they stuck a de to to the script I mean that that date the key add on in that in that in that scene is that there is at the very very close we get those out there in the house we're talking about kind of %HESITATION lines that have been burnished %HESITATION into our our memories as this iconic lines as lines that people know even if they've never even seen the movie and I'm thinking now of Louis I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship which is a lie not in the script that line that how Wallace provided but apart you know those regimes like film producer she exactly sorry the producer how Wallace provided %HESITATION very important I %HESITATION but but what you are describing the moments ago in the scene that we just that we just listen to %HESITATION those were those were lines that were in it it in the script and we were trying to sort of parsed out credit which is very very difficult task when it comes to you know who wrote what but but that Howard Koch what is a very politically engaged %HESITATION writer %HESITATION it come out of the mercury theater said he was gonna with with wells and and and had come to Hollywood and I what he what he brought to this film I think was was in in large measure his principled stance and anti fascist stands %HESITATION we don't have the the year the dead the fact that that that Rick grand guns Ethiopian fought on the side of the %HESITATION loyalists of the anti fascists in Spain we don't have those lines it and the internet Allison at stage play so Koch added those and I think in that final and the final scene that you just that we just listen to %HESITATION there too I think Howard Koch's is is helping to bestow upon this script %HESITATION that that that kind of principled stance that that Rick needs to take subordinating his own romantic interests for that for the greater good %HESITATION and that character arc that we see you know from I stick my neck out to nobody aligned that that that Rick that bogey arteries twice in the film %HESITATION to showing himself to be somebody who does just that %HESITATION to being the a reluctant war hero as as Barbara Deming called him %HESITATION but a lot of that I think comes from from the hands of of Howard Koch no Eisenberg thank you so much for talking with us about Casablanca is an extraordinary pleasure Terry thank you I appreciate it no Eisenberg is the author of the new book will always have

of The New Yorker will discuss the tensions between Taylor send and president trump hotel arsonists handling diplomacy in an administration that doesn't always seem to value it and the possibility of

of the birth of Thelonius monk jazz critic Kevin white had reminds us why monk's music is so great that's coming up on fresh air Hey I'm telling the covers and embedded it's back president Donald Trump has no record of public service but he does have a record in business and on TV in our latest round of stories we introduce you to the people who were there as he built an empire and listen on the NPR one app or where ever you get your podcast ever since NBC reported last week that secretary of state rex teller sin I called president trump a moron speculation has increased about whether teller sin will last much longer in the job my guest dexter Filkins has a new article in The New Yorker titled rex tiller send at the breaking point look and started researching the article months ago it's about the tensions between trump and Taylor St tillers and legacy at Exxon where he became CEO in two thousand six his strategy is today in dealing with North Korea and Iran and now he's presiding over a state department in which most key positions remain unfilled one of the things we're going to focus on is North Korea and the possibility of the escalating rhetoric actually leading to a war Filkins previous article for The New Yorker was about secretary of defense general James Mattis who Filkins first met when he was reporting on the war in Iraq Filkins covered the war for the New York times is now a staff writer at The New Yorker covering foreign affairs dexter Filkins welcome back to fresh air can we just start by acknowledging that the secretary of state you've just written about may not be the secretary state much longer which means your piece may have been written at exactly the right or or exactly the wrong time yeah yeah well it's great it's it's great if you're a journalist to have you know perfect timing and in this case I had perfect timing I started work on it is a long time ago not knowing that all this was going to come to a head but %HESITATION I think he's you know still on the job as we speak and I think he's pretty frustrated but that is a chaotic administration on any day of the week and so who who knows what tomorrow will bring what are you hearing about the relationship between teller centrum what is funny I'm that initially when I started talking to people and the people around him say it's great you know they talk all the time they talk several times a day trump call them you know middle that night when everyone's and I think that's true but by that you know there's a there's an actor which many of your listeners will have heard by now which is to listen was apparently in a meeting after one of he was complaining about one of trump's speeches any call them a moron and there was a you know there's another word attached to the word moron which which I won't repeat but I I think you know I think he's frustrated and I I think it's difficult for you know rex Tilson is I think of he's a pretty sober and a pretty steady guy and course the president is is anything but that and and I think to listen in particular has been trying very hard %HESITATION in places like North Korea %HESITATION we haven't you know terrible crisis on our hands to make a diplomatic solution to tried up to try to avert war I think you know the possibility of war with North Korea right now is very real and so you know flies out to China to try to make a deal and ought to try to make diplomatic deal to stave off war and the president makes fun of him any undercuts him %HESITATION rex you're wasting your time %HESITATION and I you know he's a secretary stated United States out bits I think he's up piece pretty frustrated without a feels like he can't do his job one official told you the only reason why tellers and has stayed this long as loyalty to the country yep you know he's a he's an Eagle Scout and there's there's a lot of eagle scouts in the president's cabinet and there's a lot of generals around him and somebody said to me the only people left around the president are generals in Boy Scouts and thereby hangs in there out of this not because they like it or not because there you know please to going to work everyday but because they feel responsibility to the country what have you heard about the so called suicide pact that if Taylor soon is let loose then secretary of defense medicine secretary the treasury Manouchian would leave as well they were just they would walk well I heard that I you know Washington is it's such a chatterbox and when you go down there you know it's just an echo chamber and everybody's like gossiping it's hard it's hard to know what's true I do note that Torsen madis talk a lot and I have a lot of respect for each other and I think that they you know we talk a lot because it's it's been both do with foreign affairs and you know one is the carrot %HESITATION and the other is the stick and and they're they're trying to they're trying to coordinate a lots of eight they talk a lot and and so it wouldn't surprise me if that were the case is chosen much of a carrot busy holding out many carrots well I think the carrots getting smaller I mean and I think that's the that's the concern and hammer where the stick is getting bigger and so and so if you look at their respective budgets outside the office of management and budget which is drawn up the the proposed budget for two thousand eighteen for next year which is what they're fighting about right now they would cut the state department's budget by thirty percent %HESITATION and that's it that's about the state department is the budget about th right now about fifty five billion dollars a year and that they are proposing at the same time that they're cutting the state department by thirty percent there opposing a fifty billion dollar increase for the Pentagon so so they're the proposal on the table right now is to increase spending on defense isn't as much as are nearly as much as the entire budget for the state department and so if you see if you stand back and think about that what is it wasn't mean for American foreign policy you know you've got the guns over here and you get the diplomats over here and they're cutting the resources for the diplomats and are given more resources to the guys with guns and and so I think that's what's that's what's disturbing to a lot of people right now %HESITATION that that the balance is changing but but killer scene seems to be one of the people leading the charge in dismantling the state department when you write that they're like forty eight ambassadorships that are vacant twenty one out of twenty three Assistant Secretary positions are vacant are occupied by provisional please because Congress hasn't confirmed appointees to the position %HESITATION actual much of this is intentional on rex tuitions part well I feel that there's I think there's two answers to that question the first is to answer your question he has his marching orders that's the cut the budget and to cut the number of people cut the number of diplomats working for the United States %HESITATION and he's doing that is doing that and he's or he's trying to do it and you know Congress is actually pushing back remarkably even even the Republicans in Congress are saying look this is crazy arm this is too much these cuts are too deep you know we have to have a we have to have a diplomatic presence abroad and and at the same time I think that to our son is having a very very difficult time very difficult time filling jobs and feeling you know typically at the state department you have secretary stating he surrounded by assistant secretaries of state and there's twenty five of them or so and what's happened in this case is because so many Republican let's say our senior Republicans who with with deep experience in foreign policy so many of them during the campaign publicly spoke against but trump candidacy or signed letters which were you know published in newspapers except for sang Donald Trump is not fit to be president and so the whole Republican bench that you would call on to bring in to a new Republican ministration they've they're essentially blackballed and if you go down those lists are that's a really long list it's it's most of the it's most of the real brain power die in in the Republican foreign policy establishment so the result is to listen can't get anybody took to work form let's talk about North Korea I mean president trump has said we could totally destroying North Korea North Korea has vowed to develop a nuclear missile capable of hitting the west and warned it can conduct a hydrogen bomb test over the Pacific no ambassador to South Korea has been confirmed yet trump also warned recently that this is the calm before the storm and nobody's really sure what he means by that and he's declined to clarify and it's gonna like you'll see what's so %HESITATION and and the president tweeted presidents and their administrations have been talking to North Korea for twenty five years agreements made and massive amounts of money paid hasn't worked agreements violated before the ink was dry making fools of U. S. negotiators sorry but only one thing will work and I think it's kind of implied with that one thing is but we don't really know for sure what he means so what's your sense of how close we're getting to an actual nuclear war with North Korea well I I don't of would be nuclear war but it it would be a bit of very terrible war I remember about secretary madis %HESITATION I was on his plane early this year and he said if and he's he's really sober about this arm and he said but if there is a war with North Korea it will bring the worst casualties in the worst bloodshed that any of us ever known in our lifetimes I'm you know that's that's pretty strong stuff by and I I think that I think here's where we are on the the trump administration has decided I think it's pretty clear that the prospect of North Korea getting a workable I CBM with a nuclear warhead is worse then the prospect of of war I'm so I mean I spoke to people inside the administration told me that they said we we will not allow them to have a working I CBM it's not gonna happen and we will go to war if if we have to so short of that what what can you do you can make a deal arm and and so that the plan I think this is this is what Tillotson has been working very hard on %HESITATION is to squeeze the north Koreans in there's basically one waited screes north squeeze North Koreans and that's to squeeze China to squeeze the north Koreans about it because the that the Chinese economy is kind of well it's it's the main I it's the only lever really took to Bob pressure the north Koreans and so that the Chinese have been very reluctant to do that they're there for a lot of reasons I mean the main one is they don't want to have on the north Korean state collapse on their on their borders they're terrified of that they don't want North Korea to have nuclear weapons and I don't any more than we do but so so that's that's challenge right now but I think it's also with the with the one means that the White House sees to make a deal this is working with China and that's that's what to listen has been trying to do so he's been you know flying to China well he's made several trips out there and he's he's pushing them we have channels open to the north Korean leadership arm and and so you know to get back to present trumps of that so at the same time that you know the diplomats are trying to make a deal to stave off war the president is sending out these tweets saying I'm gonna you know can annihilate North Korea eccentric and I I don't think there's any calculation involved and I think the you know the president is just you know firing okay let's take a short break here for just joining us my guest is dexter Filkins a New Yorker staff writer covers foreign affairs his new pieces called rex tiller sin at the breaking point we'll be right back it's fresh air nmcourts for this NPR podcast in the following message come from Gillette the thousands of men and women at Gillette never stop working harder to make your shape better and now get blades for less visit Gillette dot com slash lower prices pricing applies to select products and is the sole discretion of the retail rex tuition told you because you had a chance to speak %HESITATION that he'd told China that of China and the U. S. don't solve things if he and his counterpart don't solve this these two guys meaning Kim Jong moon and president trump these two guys get to fight and we will fight yeah yeah it's pretty scary did elaborate on that for you look what what yeah little bit I mean he he simply meant odd look that the way this is the the weight diplomacy works and works best is if it's backed up by a threat of force so when I walk in the room and I sit down with Chinese %HESITATION I say look I'm you and I can make a deal we can like sign it on paper and if we don't arm if diplomacy fails there's gonna be a war and and nobody wants war so %HESITATION let's let's do the deal and I and I think you know %HESITATION that sounds right I've theoretically that's out and it it sounds right it's just terrifying what is there seems to really be a game of brinkmanship being played right now yes and when when you say you you say your hope told I forget who told you this stuff if we go to war with North North Korea there will be more casualties than then what than any of us note have seen in our lifetimes and that with those secretary mouse or a right and I and you know he seen a he's seen a lot of war is in on the floor right so you have any idea what kind of war he's envisioning if we do go to war with North Korea and I hate to even utter those words near got god forbid I I think there's a lot of different options and I I mean I've had some discussions about what those options are think they're all terrible I think that the I think that that that the easy scenario to imagine it's terrible scenario is the moment %HESITATION the United States strikes North Korea say they were speaking only theoretically your arm the north Koreans have at their disposal thousands of artillery rounds that are within striking range of Seoul and I think you know much problem soul has how many people twenty million people arm and so you can imagine so if if if the leadership of North Korea is you know still alive and if %HESITATION every piece of its army is still functioning at any piece of its armies still functioning after that initial exchange then they will fire everything they have at at Seoul and I think that's you know that's that's what's got everybody's attention the prospect of that is terrible yes the bloodshed would be immense okay I know the numbers that you see here just the terrifying minutes you know tens of thousands hundreds of thousands cash I'm wondering if you feel any echoes of the eve of the Iraq war right now when President Bush and Saddam Hussein was threatened threatening each other on President Bush decided to move forward room not exactly unilaterally but not really with the backing of the UN either %HESITATION you know we had some allies but it wasn't the full force of the U. N. %HESITATION do you you covered the Iraq war you covered it right from the start so are you feeling any similarities now well that I think that the difference is in Iraq it was basically the United States I mean we you know Great Britain came along but %HESITATION in the United States was utterly determined to take out Saddam you know come what may number gonna do it and so there was this kind of like he'd listeners involved you know work we are gonna do this are in the whole world was kind of freaking out I'm it's dyed stiffen in North Korea may I do feel like I I have a lot whenever I sit down talk somebody Washington about who knows the north Korean situation I get these butterflies in my stomach because it feels like feels like these are too you know north creamy United States they're both %HESITATION people are at the moment or not willing to compromise and and that means of if that doesn't they don't reach compromise were gonna go to war and I think the prospect of war is very very real and so in that sense I think I'm feeling like pretty pretty nervous about it but but I think that in the difference between now in say in Iraq in two thousand three was that I think the whole world is pretty worried about North Korea arm you know it's a it's a kind of crazy unpredictable regime arm and I I think that the whole world is United in wanting to stop North Korea from acquiring an ICBM so did to get back to what I had said earlier I think that the the trump administration night I spoke to somebody about this some links said that we the reason why we cannot allow North Korea to acquire an ICBM it is think think of the consequences are fate they would date they might use one although start threatening Japan upstart threatening South Korea threaten United States on there it will probably prompt or could prompt the Japanese too arm reversing you know decades of being having a very very small defense force that they may have to go go nuclear on it so could destabilize the whole region you there's there's no evidence that north Koreans would ever think twice about selling their nuclear technology to another country bombs so all those things are terrifying is well and and so what what the trump administrations concluded is is that this that scenario that I just painted we cannot allow that and we will not allow that under any circumstance so it if there is a war with North Korea as it's possible there will be is there any scenario that you've heard in which the U. S. uses a nuclear weapon against North Korea yes yes I threat that conversation %HESITATION it's terrifying and it's it's not even something that you want to think about %HESITATION but I I will tell you about a conversation I had with a very senior person he said the the the problem if the north Koreans say are two inches away from acquiring the capability you know it workable nuclear arms ICBM and we need to stop that on how we do it we kill the leadership basically we take out the whole leadership Kim Jong and everyone around him now how do you do that because you know doing or they are not they all scattered and that's where the nuclear weapon came in up in the conversation that I had I'm so in other words you decapitate the regime maybe you can avert that the kind of horrible consequences that we've talked about with the north Koreans raining artillery shells down on greater soul %HESITATION but that that's pretty terrifying I think that option has been discussed I think it's on the table that's what was related to me but I mean sprint terrifying how do you use a nuclear weapon to decapitate the regime got a final I I don't know I mean his I don't know I'm I mean I I think I think that the idea it least at eight in the discussion that I had %HESITATION was was that that would be the only way that you could guarantee that you would basically obliterate the leadership are wherever it was on the the problem is that obviously is that you're gonna end up obliterating a lot of other things as well and so I you know you there's no there's no such thing as a surgical nuclear strike and so I think if you know if if nuclear weapons came into play here is the consequences would be would be horrifying our men and I don't you know I don't this is this is this is what I think this is what it's people awake at night I mean everybody's thinking about these options and there are no good options they're all bad all of them but the nuclear one of courses zero

swell investing dot com after having written this piece about rex Tyler soon for which you interviewed a lot of people in the state department and my impression is maybe some people on defense as well people in the administration what did you leave knowing that you didn't know before in terms of the larger story of where we're going with North Korea and Iran well I think I think the most thought you I've I've worked all around the globe and I've been to like a zillion American embassies around the world and you know they're all kind of the same you you gonna show your passport you go inside and you meet the diplomats in there they're all very competently as we speak the language and they know the history in the politics any kind of take it for granted you know %HESITATION we we have a really good state department and the embassies are filled with competent people but you take for granted what it where they'd what they do in there I think I think come what what I learned is that the way the world that we live in is is governed by Abe a very large kind of architecture of on economic and political arrangements that have been you know whether by treaties or agreements that have been kind of written and orchestrated and erected since the second the end of the second World War and and base would you go back to %HESITATION ag I quoted Truman's president Truman's secretary state in my piece dean Acheson if you go back that four to the nineteen late forties and early fifties you know Atchison says we we inherited a world that was in chaos and in ruins and we wanted to and it you know at at any cost we wanted to avert another World War and and how can we do this and so they came up with you know everything all these institutions that we know today about the United Nations NATO you know the European Union and and not you know the stuff is very ad hoc and kind of you know this institution got forms in nineteen forty eight the next one in nineteen fifty in the kind of evolved over time but that today we've inherited this kind of vast architecture of of arrangements and relationships and treaties and so so so that everything from band with computer bandwidth to the number of bluefin tuna that you can take out of the water every year at just the number of things which are negotiated and written down and in in codified in treaties and which are managed are every day by our diplomats because there's spewed going on all the time and these arrangements have to be changed and altered on this this is the world that we live in and this is you know that's what the world that we have and you know for all its problems but it's it's arm and and I think the thing that is troubling is anything it which is worrying and and which I think everybody needs to I think about is if we are dismantling us arm is that is that what %HESITATION secretary Tillotson and president trump are doing when they say we want to cut the the budget the state department by thirty percent %HESITATION if if I asked secretary to listen and and he said no that's not what we want to do but when you when you when you see what's happening to our diplomatic corps I mean you see what's the what the budget cuts are potentially doing on the people who are leaving the amount of expertise which is leaving it's it's scary it's scary and I I you know what worries me when when I sit down with it you know these immensely talented people at state department who are totally demoralized arm in the retiring in their leaving the quitting and these are people that you know got what it whether the when the one about the rain forest in Brazil or a bola in West Africa or you know the state of democracy in this in Gujarat in India they got somebody knows about that and they speak the language they know the history and arm and and that's I I don't know if it's if I'd go as far as to say that's being dismantled right now but it's it's under threat and and not yet that that's really troubling to me because you know what what comes after do that and it's hard to read build something this whole like network of treaties and ambassadors and %HESITATION agreements it's hard to rebuild something like that if it's torn apart yeah I mean you're talking about we really telling us American leadership in the world if you don't have American leadership who's it gonna be is going to be Russia is gonna be China and I you know that but that's a that's a very different world rex Thorsten was I mean he spent his whole career before becoming the head of the state department spends whole career at Exxon he worked his way up to C. E. O. a C. E. O. of Exxon's world view is very different from a state department heads world view and at the state department you're protecting the interests of the United States and it ExxonMobil you you're protecting the bottom line you're looking to expand markets and increase profits and sometimes that means working against the US foreign policy best interests did you talk to Taylor said about that when you had a chance to talk with him and did you get a sense that he's trying to change his the lens through which he sees the world yeah a little a little bit I think what's amazing about X. on you know what's one other world's most successful corporations it goes all the way back to Standard Oil nam at that you know decades ago on it is an enormous our company I think its annual revenues are close to four hundred billion dollars which means an insert monetary terms it's larger than most of the world's economies arm it operates in more than a hundred countries they have something like seventy thousand employees they're they're everywhere arm and they are so big I mean they are so good at what they do that are they essentially have their own foreign policy and and it it may hurt may or may not jive with what the foreign policy United states's arm but but their you know their jobs to go get the oil and if if you know the United States government and I'll give you an example so so by in two thousand twelve all of the Exxon was making a deal with with the Kurdish when regional government in northern Iraq and us a very problematic in Iraq is very problematic place but the Kurds you know they've been trying to break away from Iraq in the clear dependence %HESITATION for for years and beat the Iraqi government was opposed to acts on making a deal with the Kurds because they thought okay well and they're gonna give me awhile then they're gonna they're gonna take off on the Obama administration was against Exxon making a deal and they both the Iraqi government and the American government came back sunset please don't do this X. on that anyway that was then I was like Sandra to listen they they do their own thing pretty much and so if you take again just a couple more examples Exxon lobbied against American sanctions like it against Russia against Iran against Ukraine they lobbied against all those that you know they follow them now that they're in place but they spent millions of dollars pushing their lobbyists to block the sanctions from being imposed so so their you know their their interests are very different its appearance a private company arm and so rex delusion the C. E. O. takes off his C. E. O. hat arm he spent his career is centrally representing a private enterprise and now he's it isn't an institution which is completely different you know yes it's global in the same way that acts on his **** but the range of kind of interests and %HESITATION it's the public interest rather rather than say it out a narrow private interest and I think that that's the that's the transition that he's having to make right now so the but that means changing positions right yes yes it does and so so as the CEO of Exxon alright the Exxon was opposed to listen was supposed and lobbied against our sanctions against Iran well I and they %HESITATION Exxon by this is my piece but but Exxon set up a subsidiary of foreign subsidiary the did business with sold millions of dollars did million thousand business with Iran Syria Sudan all all countries that we have sanctions and and so now now to listen as secretary state and he's got a he's looking at piranhas as an adversary can you do that I guess you can do it but I'm it's been quite a change what you know that's a different lands entirely if you're just joining us my guest is dexter Filkins he's a staff writer for The New Yorker his new pieces called rex tiller sin at the breaking point let's take a short break here then we'll be back this is fresh air mmhm pay its guy rise here host of the Ted radio hour and if you're looking for a new podcast check out the Ted radio hour every week we explore what it means to be human we go on a journey through the big ideas emotions insights and discoveries that fill all of us with wonder you can find it on the NPR one app or however you get your podcasts do you tell a story in your article about rex Tyler summer chillers and goes into president trump's office to noon introduce a potential appointees to the state department and president trump just starts talking about how there is what I think a new regulation that prove it prevents companies from bribing foreign powers are selling until she was like we we waited work we don't do that kind we can do that kind of thing it acts on that's not what businesses are supposed to do can you explain that story and tell us what you make of it yeah it's amazing story so it did till since taking in the the the guy but he was the person he wanted to be as deputy to meet to meet president trump and you know she can't really fast and then present trump starts fulminate against of the foreign corrupt practices act %HESITATION which prevents %HESITATION American businesses from bribing %HESITATION for officials and and then trump ugh dot Tilson says to trump the ease that let me let me tell you a story president I'd I don't agree with you on that but when I was with acts on %HESITATION we did a deal in Yemen once and %HESITATION %HESITATION during the negotiation little break in the negotiation %HESITATION that the Yemeni oil minister came up to me and handed me his business card when I when I flipped it over I saw that there is a a Swiss bank account on the back of the card and then in the Yemeni well ministers leads me out five million dollars and then die any site like to listen told the president I I looked at him I said I don't do that Exxon doesn't do that and we're walking away and I went home and died two weeks later or a month later the Yemenis called tax on and said can you come back we we still want to do the deal no no bribes arm and intelligence point was what we don't play ball like that and you don't have to and I think the you know we should bring your America should bring other countries that are standard rather rather than the way around so I think coming in the president apparently was you least momentarily %HESITATION mollified no you're right that the only person who's actually like made some progress on North Korea is Nikki Haley who succeeded at the UN and getting some economic sanctions against North Korea then you write the tellers and really hates Nikki Haley how come well yeah I can I don't I don't know specifically why aids or but you know in any administration in the ego is a pretty big you know other user ferry motivated driven people with a great sense of self importance and I I think to listeners had a difficult time and and Nikki Haley was done pretty well in New York she has successfully gotten two rounds of sanctions on the north Koreans and you know she speaks publicly a lot worse Tilson is kind of and much more reluctant to speak so her star is brighter right now and so I think there's you know I think there's some resentment there and then if you go kind of deeper into the you know Washington a never ending kind of cocktail party chatter it's it's that if towers and leaves you know Nikki Haley is gonna is already to step right into that job and so does rex dealers in field Nikki Haley you know nipping at his heels are you know maybe on but but yet they clearly don't like each other too much so you profiled on general Mattox who's now secretary defense you profiled him a few months ago for the New Yorker and was you know him in Iraq so here he is like a professional worrier now heading the defense department and they had a kind of amend the rules in order to confirm him if because of any any general's post away any military person supposed to wait seven years before taking a position as secretary of defense and it was fewer years than that when he was confirmed I am so you have impressions of madness getting back to the Iraq war so as a professional warrior do you think that leaves him in a position where he would be more reluctant to send our men women men and women into work because he knows what war is like it and you know president trump has never been to war he has never seen what war is like general Mattis has at the same time that's what he knows how to do I mean he knows how to fight a war his %HESITATION his in general so so you know some people say if you see a surgeon the only thing they know how to do is perform surgery so some people wonder about general Mattis is that like the thing he knows how to do is to lead a war I'm so not in not knowing him to the extent that you do in observing him to the extent that you did to to to write your profile of him what do you think secretary matters is incredibly complex person I and it's really hard to kind of say with any great authority what he's thinking it when you ask me it's really fun to to spend time with him because he's so interesting any so well read and you ask a question and the answers you get are just really are often very surprising and super sophisticated and very colorful and he's just a really interesting guy but he is the things that you say he he's arm he has spent his life %HESITATION in uniform fighting and he's a he's absolutely first and foremost warrior having said that he is incredibly well read and has a deep appreciation I think of kind of not just the use of force but also diplomacy and and so I think I I remember you know he he's told Congress somebody decided to me as well he said look if you're %HESITATION if you're not gonna hire more diplomats then you should just buy me more bullets because arm that's what's your that's what you're gonna get basically %HESITATION you that you know he he appreciates I think the idea of that I thought you know what war or the use of force is an instrument of politics and it's not an end in itself arm Ahmed having said that though he is he's usurp as as a soldier or as a marine by he's incredibly aggressive and that's his that's his reputation I think this this goes to the heart of what I think is troubling everyone about what's happening at the state department which is I'm which is the diminishment of the state department while at the same time cut the defense department is getting you more money than ever or beat up certainly a lot more money and I got last year and that that's that's the concern which is you know if all you have is a hammer you can use a hammer and I am at and that's not I don't think that so much mass because I think he's a pretty he's a very restrained guy and he has seen war and he knows his watch people die arm but in this administration which is to say president trump and the people around him on I'm there's not a lot of evidence that they really value but the art of diplomacy %HESITATION but this they certainly understand what the military does that they got there sure is great to talk with you again thank you so much for coming back to fresh air thank you for having dexter Filkins is a staff

thorny compositions but there were skeptics all that plinking at the piano could he really plight months flat finger technique was homemade he made a lot of discoveries ways of attacking the key yield new timbres tricks of micro Tallman and precise fingering to for that year striking released two adjacent Keens just right you could sound like you're bending notes on piano as a stylist one is month learned a lot from old New York stride piano count Basie's with comic blues playing Duke Ellington's percussive jabs and from the old blues pianist who mashed together two adjacent notes to stand in for the unreachable Blue Note that lay in between monk took that idea and ran with it made little clusters and narrow intervals cornerstone of his harmony he scrunched up chords sound both old bluesy an ultramodern this composer monk wrote some fetching balance that singers later set words too and wrote more abstract lines for instrumentalists like a conventional songwriter a follow up the main melody with a repeat and then a bridge a secondary theme in another key a conventional bridge has a contrasting melody but monks bridges might repeat or paraphrase part of the main theme to intensify its affect as monk put it inside of the tune should make the outside some this is well you needn't monk wrote a few tunes inside makes the outside a little Rooty Tooty the inside almost sounds like the outside turned inside out it also has one amongst densest crunchy escorts one to stump piano students you're in orient contemporaries typically improvised over towards an ignored the melody wanted

Ukraine Russia wants to undermine Ukraine %HESITATION and undermine any Ukrainian government that would pose any kind of ideological or other challenge to Russia a Russia wants to see Ukraine as a kind of colony %HESITATION as a country that will pay it feel T. that will follow its political system that will be a comfortable place for Russians to do business so the story that you tell in your book about Stalin's war on Ukraine and how he helped orchestrate a famine in Ukraine do you see that as connecting in some way with us with what's happening now between Russia and Ukraine it kicks in a number of ways I think the most %HESITATION the most interesting way is who stones motivation stolen saw Ukraine as a problem not just %HESITATION not just for him politically but for his entire for the Bolshevik revolution %HESITATION and he's sought to undermine Ukraine and to eliminate Ukraine as a challenge %HESITATION as a as a as a sovereign nation because he feared that it could undermine Bolshevism %HESITATION and that is it's not the same but it's similar to the way it which Putin views Ukraine he sees anything any Ukraine that was pro democracy any Ukraine that was close to Europe %HESITATION politically and economically this is a challenge to his political system because his political system is a corrupt color oligarchy and he fears exactly the kind of %HESITATION emotions that led people to the streets in Kiev so I think it's fair to say that these are two rulers who have both seen in Ukraine a source of anarchy of discontent of possible %HESITATION trouble for their own political systems Ukraine in the nineteen thirties which is the period your book covers %HESITATION was seen as like the bread basket for the Soviet Union %HESITATION so when there was a famine Ukraine became especially important to the Soviet Union yes you Ukraine was important in the Soviet Union from the beginning %HESITATION as the source of much of its grain Ukraine famously has to growing seasons it has a whole region called the black earth district which is unusually fertile soil and Ukrainian important of the czarist empire %HESITATION and then later took to the USSR as a source of grain and this of course was one of the reasons why %HESITATION the the Soviet was very anxious not to lose you crate and so during the civil war in nineteen seventeen and eighteen %HESITATION enormous efforts were made to keep Ukraine to make sure that the Ukrainian %HESITATION independence movement which at that time wanted to create a sovereign Ukrainian state I didn't succeed and so there was that that motivation in addition to Stalin's fear that Ukrainian nationalism could pose a challenge to a Bolshevism ideal ideologically as well so you know there's a famine it gets worst because of it of the actions Stalin takes give us a sense of how bad the famine was in Ukraine I mean you talk about some of the things that people ate when I couldn't find food like boiling their belts and even that little eight people eight leather they ate leaves they ate grass the eight cats and dogs the eight squirrels I've read about people boiling frogs and toads %HESITATION trying to make bread or bakes things make some kind of flour out of leaves and roots %HESITATION that it you know luckier people people who live near rivers were able to fish of course and people who lived near forests were able to gather mushrooms %HESITATION but unlike your people who didn't have those kinds of %HESITATION who didn't have that kind of food source %HESITATION star very very quickly %HESITATION one of things that happens when you start as you die you can die very unexpectedly your whole system becomes weakened and so people would be would die as they were searching for food they would go into fields they would try to find leftover grain in fields that are hardly been harvested up and then they would collapse in the fields Hutton they would try walking to local train stations they would try I'm walking to cities and they would collapse along the side of the road and there and there are there are photographs of people dying by the sides of roads %HESITATION among the very few photographs that we have and their many many accounts of horror particularly of the train stations people gathered there begging is trains passed %HESITATION %HESITATION did you mean waiting and hoping to get on a train of one of the ways in which Stalin exacerbated the famine was that he created a a de facto cordon around Ukraine so Ukrainian peasants didn't have any permission to travel now that of course they sought to leave anyway %HESITATION it at people tried to sneak into cities they tried to get work in factories they tried to get off their farms yeah I'm in order to get food but the the the level of desperation was something I think we would now find very hard to imagine you tell stories about cannibalism there was cannibalism %HESITATION and you know it's it's one of these things where it Ukrainians have been very reluctant to speak about it of course and in subsequent years because it seems almost shameful to imagine that such a thing could have happened %HESITATION but cannibalism even at that time even when people are starving was never considered normal nobody ever treated it as you know as something that was not anything other than a horrible %HESITATION cannibals were caught they were arrested %HESITATION some of them were lynched %HESITATION there were there police reports giving accounts of both of cannibals and of people are for reporting cannibals and trying to turn them into the police a decade later when %HESITATION they were travelers in Ukraine a who asked about the family were told about the camera work were were stunned to hear the stories of cannibalism because of corsets it's something that's unheard of in in normal life but I'm it become you know it was almost became part of the secret history of the famine it was one of the things that people knew about and spoke about %HESITATION and we're very you know yet yet it never made it and it was never force in the newspapers it was never reported %HESITATION in any public way so there was a famine that was being caused by natural reasons but you said that Stalin orchestrated a famine within the famine in Ukraine I actually have to be more precise there were no natural reasons for this famine I'm there was no weather issue there were no insects none of the things that normally because famines and this was a famine that was entirely caused by political decisions and so first there was a general decision about collectivized ation and that meant that the the Soviet peasantry this is all over the Soviet Union not just in Ukraine up were forced to leave their homes and to join collective in state farms in this because their enormous amount of disruption peasants resisted it they fought back sometimes they fought back violently %HESITATION there were two teams of activists were sent into the villages to persuade them to do it all of farming was reorganized and the effect was a huge drop in food production a partly as as people left their homes they had no incentive on the new farms to work but also just the general disruption led to a %HESITATION five far less food being available but as you say that that famine reached your became it became clear that people are starving in nineteen thirty two but what happened in Ukraine was that at that moment the Soviet Union took out the Soviet polit bureau took a decision to exacerbate the famine inside Ukraine so so that within this general Soviet famine which affected many people in Russia and Kazakhstan and other places there were also decisions taken that particularly affected Ukraine the cordon drawn around Ukraine and there were villages and towns and farms or blacklisted in Ukraine up and there were decisions that only affected Ukraine were made to make the famine worse there what was Stalin's goal and collectivized in the farms and basically throwing peasants and landowners in Ukraine off the land the goal of collective a station was in effect to turn the peasants into kind of proletariat who would be they would be independent they wouldn't have their own lands they could make their own decisions they would be under state control %HESITATION I think is one of the ideas he had was that this would be more efficient I think there was also a political reason to it %HESITATION in that this would extend Soviet power into the countryside so you know inside the cities it was easier to control people you could nationalise industry you could make people work decide where people work in the countryside people had their own property so this was in effect removing people's private property as a way of controlling them on his goal in Ukraine specifically was a little bit different in other words if if the collective is Asian was the first wave %HESITATION of political changes in Ukraine and then the famine had an additional goal which was to weaken the %HESITATION that sort peasant resistance in Ukraine and to weaken the Ukrainian national movement %HESITATION which he saw as being connected to the peasantry and he PP spoke about this more than once I'm so he his idea was that he would eliminate Ukraine as a kind of political problem so you know the pet the peasantry was a general issue that affected all of the Soviet Union and then the %HESITATION the particular problem of Ukraine as a as a as a the peasants being them the main component of this nationalist movement %HESITATION would be he would eliminate them by weakening them through mass starvation also through mass arrests so one of things Stalin did was move in a lot of Russians from Russian cities move them into the Ukraine and what we do replace some of the peasants from Ukraine with these urban Russian workers so there are two things that happened one one is that in order to carry out the famine there were teams sent from Russia and also from Ukrainian cities up to that first of all to collectivized the presence and then later on to requisition their grain as well as much of their other food on the activist teams went house to house and they took people's food away literally all of their food everything that they had and confiscated it secondarily after the famine in nineteen thirty three nineteen thirty four nineteen thirty five there were Russians sent from other parts of the Soviet Union to colonize the anti Ukrainian villages there were whole sways of the countryside where nobody lived anymore and so Russians were brought in to rasa fi rule Ukraine and there's a dispute about how effective that was some people stayed some people exert very interesting letters written from some of the Russians who were brought into those and the communities they didn't really know where they were being sent to and they were horrified to discover corpses they discovered you know that fields hadn't intended they didn't really know where they've been brought to and some some left but it's certainly true that over the subsequent ten and twenty and thirty years Ukraine not just roar Ukraine but all of Ukraine was russified quite comprehensively about Russians came in and took over of many the jobs in the Ukrainian Communist Party in Ukraine institutions %HESITATION but also in the countryside replacing the missing Ukrainian so in effect the famine was a part of a larger process of attempted russification of Ukraine of replacement of the Ukrainian language with Russian of replacement of people who identified themselves as Ukrainians with Russians from Russia essentially or the Soviet ties Ukraine so that it became a a more willing colony of the Soviet Union if you're just joining us my guess is an apple Baum she's the author of the new book read famine Stalin's war on Ukraine she's

swell investing dot com so in addition to all of this are also mass deportations of Ukrainians I think like tens of thousands of Ukrainians were deported during the peered out of this famine what were the reasons for the deportation part of collectivized ation and part of it why collectivized ation was possible was that Stalin demonized a part of the rural population calling them cool locks and this is a word that meant rich peasants %HESITATION many the people who are called cool locks weren't rich by any normal standard I mean they might have to pigs and sort of wonder they might have you know of you know two and a half Hector field instead of a one and a half Victor field and but in in many them of course weren't rich dole you could become a Coolock if you opposed collectivized ation you could be one you could be considered one if you %HESITATION if you refuse to hand over all of your grain or all of your food to the activist brigades %HESITATION but the demonization of the court was useful to Stalin because it created divisions and hatred inside a Ukrainian villages and he would he would he would turn that the system was designed to turn part of the population against the other parts of the cool locks word you know you're why are you suffering why don't you have enough food wise your family supports the fault of the Ku Klux blame the Coolock they're responsible for all of your problems and he used that kind of rhetoric actual across the Soviet Union the cities as well so the workers in the cities who also suffered from food shortages were told it's the cool locks fault you know their standing in the way of our revolution the reason why the revolution isn't succeeding is because the cool locks are stopping it up in part of collectivized nation was a kind of there was this mass propaganda campaign against the cool locks and there was also a process of deportation of the cool locks %HESITATION tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people up from Ukraine were sent %HESITATION both into the the more distant parts of the Soviet Union into the far north in the Far East I'm to live his exiles and a portion of them were sent into the gulag where they became slave laborers in effect and I it's funny I ran into them in an earlier book that I wrote about the gulag there's a kind of spike in the glove population that happens in nineteen thirty thirty one thirty two and that is of course the cool locks being deported from Ukraine and other parts of the USSR and that it would that was that that was the height of this %HESITATION kind hate campaign was conducted against them was this mass deportation so when you stand back now how would how successful would you say Stalin was in defeating Ukrainian nationalism and in %HESITATION altering the population of Ukraine so that it would identify more with Russia and last with a nationalist movement in Ukraine still it was successful in it in the nineteen thirties in the nineteen forties in repressing what had been %HESITATION a national movement that might have in a different context been successful remember done at the time that you you know Ukraine sought to have its own state in nineteen seventeen eighteen this was a time when lots of European states were our European nations rather were becoming states for the first time you think or or for the first time having lost stated earlier if you think of Poland you think of Czechoslovakia you think of Lithuanian %HESITATION Estonia Latvia up so wasn't an uncommon %HESITATION desire in democratic liberal nationalism was it was an important movement and %HESITATION in this era %HESITATION but and stolen succeeded at least in repressing that movement and in destroying it for but you know for the time being for his lifetime in and immediately afterwards up but he didn't succeed in destroying the memory of it and but you know all the famine you know did it it destroyed the peasants desire to resist in there was no further peasant resistance and then the mass arrest of intellectuals %HESITATION you have effectively eliminate the leadership of the national movement the memory of it remained of people the memory the famine remain people kind of kept it alive in their families %HESITATION the grandparents told grand children what happened and people people went back they kept the old tax the old stories and in the nineteen eighties and nineteen nineties as the Soviet Union began to fall apart up Ukrainians went back to that movement and they they saw heroes and they sought %HESITATION examples of what kind of a nation they could be in that in the post Soviet world in that movement so in a sense in a stolen destroyed it for you or for the Soviet union's lifetime but it emerged and and you know in a sense the emergence of an independent Ukraine one with its own identity that was different from the Soviet Union %HESITATION and Ukraine's then declaration of independence and its refusal to join the into a kind of post Soviet Union with with Russia and and the rest of the USSR in nineteen ninety one was really instrumental in ending the Soviet Union any without Ukraine %HESITATION Russia really saw no purpose and in keeping the Soviet Union going and are trying to keep it going so in that sense Stalin was right deter deter a revived and national Ukrainian state would destroy the Soviet Union and eventually did so Stalin destroyed it for of time but he did destroyed forever and it did come back and the Ukraine that we have today %HESITATION is one that knows this history it knows the history of the nineteen twenties and the history the famine %HESITATION and that's part of what makes up its identity right now my guess is an apple Baum author of the new book read famine

use the promo code fresh to start your free trial today one of things you do at the London school of economics is that you help run a project that studies disinformation so are you studying disinformation in elections and what have you been looking at so it's a project that looks that we have a range of things we're doing and one of them yes was a project that examined Russian attempts to manipulate the German election campaign mostly online but not only looking at ways in which the Russian government and agents of the Russian government or or representatives the Russian government or even just ordinary Russians were attempting to help the far right when the German election campaign what were the techniques and tactics that they used online what were the messages that they used how were they trying to create divisions really within Germany because that was the messaging that the alternative for Germany the German far right was trying to use and you know it since work more on the topic of of my book it's seven it's really not an accident that I heard interested in this issue because so much of why the Ukrainian famine was possible so much why stones atrocities were possible was because of the way in which the Soviet Union used disinformation propaganda and what we would now call hate speech and to encourage people to do terrible things as a why did people go along with to tell Italian is and why did they go on dictatorship they were persuaded to do so by this very divisive and bitter rhetoric I don't wanna make a direct comparison between the Soviet Union the president things are very different in that's up to an interesting conversation to to to dissect why but they are but nevertheless some of the you know some of the thinking of the current Russian government of the people who run its propaganda system has echoes of the past uncritically this idea of divisiveness scapegoating you know what's wrong with my life you know it can't be ever my fault I'm what's wrong with my society it can't be our own decisions we have to find a scapegoat we have to find enemies %HESITATION this is what the German far right does it identifies Muslims and Islam and and refugees and foreigners as and Emmy's and that that gives them that that seems to be a name right now doesn't it it is a it is a very broad theme all across the west and it's something that the Russians have identified as something they can use they can push to help divide and disorganized western democracies they've done it in multiple countries you know they did it in our country the United States and they were doing in Germany in Germany it was a much smaller operation they have they've a wide range of interest in Germany so it's not just I'm not just in the far right they also have some other kinds of stakes there but it's not an accidental link mean they they think about how do we make people angry how do we make people afraid how do we create scapegoats you know they they understand that those are ways you can unify people to do all kinds of things if you can make them all angry at the same enemy what does Russia want in Germany Russia wants in Germany what it wants everywhere in Europe which is it wants to end of the European Union %HESITATION which it sees as a as a as a as something that for its its ability to do corrupt deals on do bilateral deals in Europe %HESITATION and so it's it's supports political parties that are against the European Union it wants to and NATO because it wants the United States and its influence %HESITATION out of Europe more generally it it seeks to undermine and and dislodge liberal democracy wherever it can %HESITATION partly for practical reasons because you know for us in companies would be a lot easier to do you know they're they they do business using corrupt methods and it would be more useful to them to do business in states where our rule of law isn't so respected and they can bribe people and in other words they're looking to export corruption rather than and it and it helps to undermine democracy to do that but I think they also seek to undermine democracy for for a bigger reason namely that democracy rhetoric or the %HESITATION the ideals of a rule of law and freedom of speech and freedom of decision %HESITATION these are ideals that are are undermining for the current Russian regime it's an oligarchic corrupt dictatorship and so what it fears the most is the eye is that you know people on the streets calling for democracy and so did extent to which you can undermine its neighbors and undermine their democracies is good for them then they can point to their own people and say look you know democracy is a disaster doesn't work in United States it doesn't work in Germany %HESITATION and so why should you wanted either so I'm gonna Merkel won the election in Germany but the far right gain seats it did very well in the election suit do you attribute that to the Russians no I don't the Russians the Russians don't invent %HESITATION the far right they've they they can't they don't advent political parties in foreign cars until they have tried to a few times it doesn't usually work what they do is they seek to help %HESITATION either sometimes with money and sometimes with %HESITATION advice %HESITATION and sometimes with online trolling invite campaigns and so on they seek to help the far right in really almost every European country they have a %HESITATION they have allies I'm in the French election campaign the supported Marilla pen that they did with money that she was given financial aid and she's the far right candidate in France %HESITATION in Germany they had advisors they had an online campaign that was designed to help the far right using techniques that they've been working on perfecting over number elections actually going back many years this is something they've been working on for a long time what does the far right stand for in Germany is it still connected to the the former **** party is a deeply anti semitic no the modern far right actually tries not to be connected to the **** party not least because the **** ism is illegal in Germany literally legal %HESITATION and your you you're not allowed to display a swastika the far right his instead organized itself around anti European anti immigration issues %HESITATION so it it agitate against Germany's membership of various international clubs and it argues for heavy restrictions on immigration and deportation of immigrants some of the language that they use is a little bit %HESITATION you know what in America we call dog whistling so sometimes they say things that have any semitic echoes or %HESITATION and what one of their leaders did say something about how it's time to stop being ashamed of the German soldiers who fought in World War two when we should remember me implying that we should remember the very mocked more positively and so there are some echoes of of those links but no they can't be openly pro **** in Germany because it's it's against the law so I own how effective do you think the Russians were in helping the far right getting new seats in parliament it's very hard to measure the Russian impact but %HESITATION they were certainly trying to help the far right they certainly have close links to the far right %HESITATION they certainly help their online campaign to a considerable degree they they helped boost the far right's presence on a German social media %HESITATION day project we help the German far right inside the there's a there's a large Russian speaking community in Germany %HESITATION mostly people who emigrated from the old Soviet Union and they made huge efforts to %HESITATION atrophy him at attract those people to the to the German far right as well so that you you you can't do an exact measurement but they may well have had an impact if you're just joining us my guess is an apple bomb she is the author of the new book read famine Stalin's war on Ukraine she teaches at the London school of economics and is a columnist for The Washington Post the sticker really short break we'll be right back this is fresh air mmhm pay its guy rise here host of the Ted radio hour and if you're looking for a new podcast check out the Ted radio hour every week we explore what it means to be human we go on a journey through the big ideas emotions insights and discoveries that fill all of us with wonder you can find it on the NPR one app or however you get your podcasts one of people being investigated and America no in the end vested Asians into that trump campaign and Russian interference in the election is Paul mana fort who was an adviser in Ukraine he advised president Viktor Yanukovych and his party Inanna Kovic fled the country and in twenty fourteen after there were protests against him and his anti democratic %HESITATION I efforts so you are studying Ukraine at the time that Paul metaphor was doing that advising how soon did you find out about him and what how did you interpret his his role there so when Paul metaphor was appointed to be trump's campaign manager I had this horrible feeling of my worlds clashing so I didn't working on Ukraine which is it you know from the American point of view it's not a mainstream subject at someone off to the side so I did know about metaphors role there and suddenly I saw him brought into the center of US politics you know I suddenly realize that everything he done and all of the ways in which Ukrainian politics have been conducted over the last seven years was suddenly going to be relevant to the U. S. election as indeed it was the kinds of campaigning that he he was part of her would have known about in Ukraine the for example the just that the use of online trolling the use of extensive internet disinformation campaigns this is something I knew from Ukraine this is what the Russians did in Ukraine and others that creation these big kind of violent rallies where people get beaten up this is another Ukrainian election tactic in a way he he brought this post Soviet form of politics to the United States and when I saw that happening it was it was a kind of shock as I say it was a %HESITATION not something I expected to see I mean you know there's a way in which the you know perhaps we've come full circle Manute United States in western Europe exported liberal democracy in democratic politics to the east %HESITATION in the nineteen nineties that we've now had a kind of re export so therefore their way of doing politics this as I said violent divisive angry politics designed to pit people against one another and to build political coalitions based on a hate campaigns this is something that's been done in Ukraine it's been done in other parts of the post Soviet world %HESITATION he brought it or he and he and others brought it to the United States what was meant for known for it in terms of his his campaign style in Ukraine well one of things he was known for was his remake of Viktor Yanukovych of Victor gonna go which was the president of Ukraine %HESITATION who had previously been part of an attempt to buy an election a few years earlier he'd been part of an adult attempted election fraud and so many for its job was to remake him you know thibs gonna comb his hair and buy him better shoot suits and I'm teaching headed speak properly and to organize his campaign and probably also to organize the publicity and the you know the online campaign around him %HESITATION and that's that's what he was known for is on the way he was it took a very thuggish %HESITATION former criminal actually and made him into somebody who seemed more presidential this is what he was best known for Ukraine he was also known for corruption unwanted things that happened during the U. S. election campaign that I don't think got that much attention was that a group of Ukrainian %HESITATION MPs and journalists went back through their records %HESITATION and went did a little bit of investigation and found out there was a there was a kind of party ledger from the president's the gonna coaches party that described who they'd been paying bribes or who they've been paying it off the books money too during wall wall unit of isn't powerful if one of them was meant afford this was publicized during the trouble action campaign while metaphor was the campaign manager so you felt when you were watching the bomb the trump campaign during the period that metaphor was the campaign manager that that you are seeing the exportation of Russian style politics and disinformation being imported by metaphor into the U. S. yes I actually wrote this column %HESITATION in the spring of last year saying that what were what metaphor is and what we're seeing with the trump campaign is Russian style politics in the United States you're actually writing about Russia the former Soviet Union Ukraine at a very a very good time to be studying this because archives were opened after the fall of the Soviet Union you drew on those archives to write your book about the about Stalin's war in Ukraine when he orchestrated a famine in nineteen thirty two and thirty three in Ukraine what are some of the things you found in the archives because I'm thinking like the the things that were of that Stalin did were kept secret and they were kit kept secret for for for decades you know officially secret it wasn't taught the famine wasn't taught in schools it was covered up do they keep records so it's a very interesting thing yes the Soviet Union kept extensive records %HESITATION it kept extensive records of its when gulag camps that kept records of its mass murders on all of that is absolutely available in the archives I remember this was a political system that never expected to collapse you'd imagined it would go on forever and it you know nobody would ever see those archives and certainly nobody like me are you would be discussing those archives and so that the archives are kept for their own reasons to keep their own keep track of their own population of the KGB also used archives and used its own history up kept track of its own history or to study it %HESITATION the KGB would study past our operations in order to learn from them of I've actually seen you know Kate deserve the KGB road its own histories which kept in its archives and you can read that and see that as well now to whether actual ledger books kept about how many people were deported each day %HESITATION how many people had food taken away from them each day there were ledgers kept of deportations more less %HESITATION so they because they needed to know the numbers how many trains how many people would end up in camps and so on on the numbers statistics on numbers of people died or more complicated because as the phone was happening a the state decided to conceal it and so there's a lot of circumstantial evidence and some other evidence showing that doctors for example would put false reasons for death on people's death certificates at so they wouldn't say that somebody died of famine they would give some other reason and so the numbers for famine have only been recently calculated user as it did but by demographer's going into birth and death records and looking at statistically how many people should have died in a given year %HESITATION and comparing them to the actual numbers %HESITATION but yet the state the state certainly kept numbers of you know who was where and how many people %HESITATION you know how many people were available certainly to work in %HESITATION in labor camps so you're living in England and Poland to have that right that's correct but you're American so you been watching even watching American politics from the perspective of living in Europe so how does it look to you from where you are like what are you saying what are you hearing around you a it's a really broad question but I just figure you have a different perspective being being an American but living in Europe right now you know most Europeans look on the United States right now with the kind of distress that you would feel if you were stranded on a desert island and you saw off in the distance the ship that was coming to rescue you at sinking you know the United States for Europeans has been for many decades a kind of a source of comfort stability %HESITATION and the nuke it offered through its countries that don't have nuclear weapons it offers nuclear umbrella %HESITATION but it's not just the military link it say ideological link a political link and economic link you know the United States has really been the anchor of the west you know the most important western country the biggest country but also the one that was most convinced of its own %HESITATION of its own ideals that was most Datin devoted to the idea of democracy and to %HESITATION the ideas of free speech and free commerce and free trade and all the things that have made the request rich and prosperous I'm in the last year has caused many to wonder whether how long that's going to go on being true %HESITATION you know not only does trump not speak the language that American presidents have spoken for the last have in certainly since the second World War of of alliances and friendships I'm he also doesn't seem to speak the language of democracy he doesn't talk about it he doesn't promoted he doesn't seem interested in and %HESITATION when he makes big speeches he he seems to tiptoe around it and it you know they see him as somebody who chooses to be divisive rather than unifying and people worry for the whole western alliance for the western camp you know how long can we continue to be cohesive how long can we continue trading with each other as seamlessly as we've been trading %HESITATION how long will remain remain at power and a voice in the world if he is the first of many of a different kind of American president well Anne Applebaum thank you so much for talking with us thank you so

our book critic Maureen Corrigan recommends a new short story collection like no other here's a review of the Obama inheritance fifteen stories of conspiracy Nawar it's a commonplace these days to say that real life has become so unpredictable that it outstrips anything anyone could dream up in fiction I think I'm guilty of having made that banal observation a few times but that was before I read the Obama inheritance a collection of fifteen stories so sly fresh and Bizarro world witty they reaffirm the resiliency of the artistic imagination as editor Gary Phillips explains in his forward the idea for the Obama inheritance was a cumulative thing born out of the fact that there were so many conspiracy theories generated about president Obama there were the bursar stories the suggestion that president Obama you secret whether machines to cause her cane sandy and on and on Phillips says to many of us the daily rollout of these preposterous notions about the nation's first black president was laughable the US Phillips refers to are a diverse group of writers in terms of race and reputation their practitioners of a variety of genres noir sci fi and fantasy Phillips who's written some terrific hard boiled mysteries himself invited each of these contributors to choose one Obama conspiracy theory and refine it take it apart and turned it on its head and give the reader a thrill ride of weird old warrior sh pulpy goodness the over arching aim of all this outlandish Innis is to entertain as well is to talk some social criticism into the formulaic folds of these tales of spooks spies private dies clones bots and alien invaders truly fabulous story kicks off this collection remember all those loud whispers sparked by a fist bump that Michelle Obama was a covert black power separatist in Michelle in hot water crime writer Kate flora takes that conspiracy fantasy about the First Lady and runs with it here's how the story opens the big man with a Russian accent Warren expression somewhere between a smirk and a smile not a pleasant smile but the smile of someone who likes to inflict pain and was about to do just that Michelle wasn't afraid of him bullies had been common in the part of Chicago where she grew up her years in the White House had shown her plenty more even if they did hide behind expensive suits and artificial courtesies no what scared her was the predicament she had gotten herself into and the trouble it was going to cause for her team Faiza from state Leila from the surgeon general's office Carissa from the Pentagon lord this from the FDA and Alice from justice Michelle dressed in full combat gear and a mission impossible word the disguise of fake skin has just gotten caught by that Russian enforcer in the middle of the vigilante mission

fighting drugs for kids when as always the drug makers initially refuse First Lady Michelle and her sister Amazons devise ways to inject these fat cats with a drug that temporarily renders them impotent incontinent and bold part of the fun of this story is the repartee that flora conjures up between Michelle and Barack like FDR Barack realizes that his way word activist wife can't be reined in another standout is mystery grandmaster Walter Moseley's complex tale cold a different frame of reference which takes birth arisen to its logical alien and point think of president Obama as the

genetically altered anaconda as an elegant allusions to Ralph Ellison's invisible man in recent years writers of color have taken up sci fi and fantasy in particular as ritually politic vehicles to

written for The New York Times The New Yorker and other publications is the author of books about Al Capone Lou Gehrig Jackie Robinson and the creation of the birth control pill he spoke to fresh air is Dave Davies about his new book Ali a life well Jonathan eig welcome back to fresh air you know Mohammed Ali did you have big ambitions as a kid the biggest of you know he started saying when he was twelve the very first time he stepped into a boxing ring he started saying I'm going to be the greatest boxer of all time to be the heavyweight champion of the world it you know it's preposterous he didn't first of all no he was gonna grow big enough to be a heavy weight arm he absolutely believe that %HESITATION he would sit in class I'm dreaming of of hearing his accomplishments announced on the loudspeaker he would doodle pictures of himself in a Golden Gloves robot arm he just had this this vision that that's what he was going to do and he I'm told everybody from the early as possible age this is not something that he cooked up when he became you know the Mohammed Ali he he he always believed in himself somehow how did you get in a box he was riding his bicycle when they get a brand new fifty dollar Schwinn and %HESITATION you know for his family as his dad was you know was a sign painter made submit decent money but wasn't well off by any stretch we had this fifty dollar Schwinn that he shared with his brother and they were riding together one on this handlebars one on the seat I went downtown with a couple of other friends started to rain so they ducked into this building and that when they came back out the bike was gone been stolen so while he was furious and he was Cassius clay at that point but he was furious he went looking for the kids who stole his bike anyone looking for a police officer to report the crime and he found a police officer guy named Joe Martin working in the basement of the Columbia auditorium and in the basement Joe Martin was giving a boxing clinic teaching kids how to box and Ali was just immediately entranced you almost forgot about his bike he gets so excited seeing the boxing gym smelling the sweat and maybe most importantly seeing black kids and white kids in the ring together this was a black kid hitting a white kid in the face you're not supposed to if there had been any other part of America on but the boxing ring it was okay and Ali became just fascinated I went back to that Jim %HESITATION day after day and became the hardest worker in John Martin's Jim he wins the gold medal in the Olympics in Rome in nineteen sixty and then cut comes back but bit of a celebrity how does he get together the financing for a career in this is not a kid who had any money after the Olympics what happen Ali is really unusual and and may be unique in the history of boxing to that point %HESITATION these very wealthy white businessmen from Louisville on the call themselves the Louisville sponsoring group decided basically to finance and manage Ali's career for him to keep them away from the dangerous elements that were in boxing at the time they didn't want him to fall into the hands of some of the people who were associated with the mafia and these guys have so much money they weren't in it for themselves and they thought they might make a little profit on a the follies career went well but they knew that most boxers on did not rise to the championship they were doing this kind of a civic %HESITATION deed they thought that this was good for the community that it was good for %HESITATION one of their own to help this kid from from %HESITATION the west end of Louisville to go as far as he could with his boxing thing he had a gold medal already so there was certainly some promise and these guys put Ali on a salary which was completely unheard of for boxing he was guaranteed money every month every year %HESITATION regardless of how well he boxed they managed his fights they chose the fights where they hire train form they pay all his expenses all of his food and lodging bills it was really an extraordinary deal and a and a great relationship that Ali have treasured for for years so he does well begins winning professional fights and then at some point another force in his life emerges in that's the nation of Islam talk a bit about his perceptions of race and how you know how the nation of law Islam if that field what Ali was the same age as Emmett till and everybody knew what had happened and it till for first speaking back giving sass to a white woman he was killed brutally and the %HESITATION the killers got away with it and Ali's father was it was a race man EP was a Garvey I do believe that black people were never gonna get a fair deal in this country that I just have to go back to Africa if they were ever going to have a a fair shake and I grew up in steeped in that kind of thinking and talking and when he heard about the nation of Islam which was this %HESITATION little known group at the time but was with growing force especially in the home American ghettos and and in American prisons where they did a lot of outreach work %HESITATION he was a group saying that a little bit like what his father had been saying that that America was never going to be fair to African Americans that their only hope was to form their own powerful organization to start their own businesses and eventually to force America to give them their own territory and Ali heard about this I I found the letter that he wrote when he first explained why he became a Muslim why he got interested nation of Islam and it wasn't really about the religion that was about the cultural issues he loved these idea that black people to take responsibility for their own lives and and I think this for somebody who %HESITATION is boxing who's having it the opportunity to build his own life but through discipline through training hard work and getting the ability to to be treated as an equal at least in the boxing ring the nation of Islam really struck a chord with them but not the leader of course was Elijah Mohammed but a rising star within the nation of Islam was Malcolm acts to you know wrote that famous autobiography later had a falling out with the leadership of the nation of Islam and was murdered he became close to Alli what was their relationship Ali enough comics were like little brother Big Brother Baum Malcolm was this very charismatic brilliant man who'd it also come from %HESITATION humble beginnings and taught himself and very much live to the the ethos of the nation of Islam when it came to self improvement and he is also a big boxing fan so he loves hanging around Ali Ali was just this unbelievable personality everybody just loved being in his presence one of his first girlfriends told me that it was impossible not to have fun it was impossible to be a bad mood when you were in the room with Ali so he and Malcolm really hit it off and %HESITATION I think Malcolm became a real mentor to amend taught him that the philosophy that Elijah Muhammad was teaching was a really powerful one and that Ali could could go into the ring believing that he had a la on his side that that that he was had a calling that that he was doing something much bigger than boxing here that he had an opportunity to really change the world if he was successful so a pivotal episode in Mohammed Ali's career were his two fights with Sonny Liston in nineteen sixty four in nineteen sixty five I remember this as a kid tell us first about Sonny Liston Sonny Liston was %HESITATION one writer called in the nightmare in white America's closet that he was this big frightening guy who does not his opponents out and he was he was kind of an ogre he beat up policemen %HESITATION he you know had a had a criminal record and he was seen is unbeatable he was just too big and too strong and he'd he'd knocked out his last few points in just a matter of seconds so the strong opinion among the media and among boxing fans was that this kid Cassius clay this this little quick moving fighter had no chance getting in the ring against a listen the only question was whether he was going to be knocked out or kill the interesting thing is that by the time they had that first fight and I didn't realize this until I read your book then Cassius clay was a huge celebrity already he had been on the cover of time he'd been the Johnny Carson show and he and he demanded a fight with Sonny Liston arm and he spent a lot of time building up to the fight talking trash and thought we would listen to a little bit of tape from back in nineteen sixty four the scissors that in the build up to the fight and this begins with an a a question from a reporter yeah can I ask you how you're feeling now at this point in bodybuilding great unreasonable the wall right now well when you say you're ready to go to war right I've read about on the street obscene in the bowl of fights do they actually take a month before the fight in Markham is bad I thought when he was in a few days ago Danny albeit I have he's still alive who would be world champ the world champs to be pretty like meat well he told me to bet my life that you wouldn't go three rounds well if you want to lose your money them battle in front so how may I ask because I'll never lose a fight with some possible felony rhythm problem very well for me right now stampede among bears little left on the loan fund to prayer Chadbourne blundering carried on a ground ball to camp with the three of oz I'm not able to battle Carmel container I'm up rapid on the resurrected numbers but you don't know boxing world it was a meter data bases one of a kind of an early hates her Cassius clay %HESITATION before his fight with Sonny Liston you know this practice of his of berating and humiliating opponents remained a trademark to the end of his career how much of this was real and how much of it was promotional schtick somebody once asked in that and he said seventy percent for fifty you had a number it is by seven percent under which the Senate the present was was real %HESITATION he said but %HESITATION it was fascinating because he was brilliant marketing guy him he understood that he was gonna get a fight with Sonny Liston sooner than anybody else before he was really qualified based on his boxing record because he was making so much noise and his first nickname was the Louisville lip %HESITATION and it was meant with the statement that it was a bad sport he was he was behaving like a child he was modeling is behavior in part on gorgeous George the wrestler who you know came into the ring with his hair in curlers who's just trying to make the crowd angry and Ali saw gorgeous George who that's a good idea it was good business to be hated in other words it was brilliant and %HESITATION he ends up becoming I'm even more hated for for more legitimate reasons in any becomes the most beloved man %HESITATION in the history of boxing so it you know that it's fascinating to see how well he manipulated that we're listening to the interview fresh shares Dave Davies recorded with Jonathan eig author of a new biography of Mohammed Ali called Ali a life we'll hear more of their conversation after a break I'm Terry gross and this is fresh air weekend support for this podcast

good business invest in progress at swell investing dot com soon after this Cassius clay no longer is Cassius clay where did his noon name Muhammad Ali come from we know medially after the fight he makes this very bold pronouncement that really shocks everybody he admits he's a member of the nation of Islam and that he's not going to accept this Christianity anymore this was a slave religion that was that was forced on him at that and these people during slavery and he was free to choose whatever he wanted any makes this important declaration of independence really he says I don't have to be what you want me to be a lot to say what you want me to say I don't do what you want me to do I'm free to be who I am and that's really I think maybe the defining moment in Ali's career it is coming out and at a time when African Americans are expected to be subservient in American culture for him to say I can do what I want was was radical and then joining the nation of Islam was was even more radical and then shortly afterward %HESITATION he announces that he's changing his name to caches ex our ministers he does that Elijah Muhammad calls and says no I've got a different name for you I'm giving you a greater honor I'm going to give you a new first and last name which was only given two very important people within the organization he says your new name will be Mohammed Ali Mohammed Ali faces a tough decision because his friend Malcolm Max splits with Elijah Muhammad who is the leader of the nation of Islam what what did the Muhammad Ali do in the circumstance you know it's an important crossroads in Ali's life but it was not a difficult decision for him in fact because he was so fiercely loyal to Elijah Muhammad that he would do anything for the messenger as you call them and when Elijah Muhammad broke with MalcolmX I'll MalcolmX had been a long running feud with a lot of how he's been suspended for the nation of Islam he had accused Elijah Muhammad of having all these affairs with the secretaries and impregnating them and %HESITATION there were some who felt like Elijah Muhammad had %HESITATION suggested that it would be okay if MalcolmX were assassinated but all the %HESITATION did not struggle with this decision at all and he was actually quite cold toward Malcolm and said that he thought Malcolm deserve to die before the assassination so %HESITATION at one point Malcolm's wife approached Ali and said please help me do something there have been attempts on Malcolm's life already and I'll be brushed off so Muhammad Ali at has a second fight bad with Sonny Liston takes him out in one round there's controversy about it %HESITATION but he's then on top of the world I mean he is that he is the heavyweight champion and missed and a national celebrity and he runs into a problem with his draft status I mean the of the Vietnam War was beginning to heat up what what happens to the tally with with the draft board Ali is on top of the world is the heavyweight champ is making money very quickly he's buying all the cars he wants and things life is looking good yeah still wildly unpopular as a result of his association with the nation of Islam reporters are refusing to call the Muhammad Ali they almost all still refer to him as Cassius clay as if five you had no choice and in his name they were gonna call what they wanted a column and then he gets even more unpopular when he says he doesn't want to serve if he's drafted in in Vietnam first he says I just don't want to go you know send some other athletes of their sense of football players I'm making a lot of money right now in the government's taken a lot of that money in taxes and they can use my taxes to buy the all the bomber jets they want all the tanks they want they can go over there and kill all the Vietnamese they want just don't send me I don't wanna go and then he starts to involve on that position in the says well I'm opposed to this because I'm treated like a second class citizen in this country black people actually go fight for our country when we're treated like second class citizens and why should we go over there and kill some dark skinned Asians went dark skinned people here are suffering and and and black people are dying in these hugely disproportionate numbers in in the war what why should I be a part of that so now he's beginning to make it a political argument and then after a little more time goes by and he speaks to mop to Elijah Muhammad about this then he begins to say well it's also a religious issue that I'm I'm a conscientious objector because my faith says that we don't fight in wars in in them in earthly wars so it's really interesting to see his position involved but no matter how it involves he just becomes more and more unpopular more hated I think you'd be mate he may be the most hated man in America at this point right he it in the end is charged and convicted of draft evasion and sentenced to five years in prison which he appealed was he treated differently than other draft resisters the key was treated differently in I uncovered %HESITATION FBI files on on Ali that hadn't been seen before and they show that the government was really frightened that if Ali succeeded in avoiding the draft that it would it would send this terrible message to others that they could avoid it the same way that the nation of Islam's membership would search that everybody in a black person in America or certainly many of them flock to the nation of Islam because it would keep them out of Vietnam and that they were very worried about that it really is it with it froze his career writing the his title was stripped he was them state boxing council's refused to let him a compete he was essentially on ice right that's right that's another way in which he was treated arm differently there's nothing that says that a convicted felon at Cannes cannot box there are plenty of convicted felons in the in the boxing ring most states allow them arm to box he should've been allowed to box while his case was on appeal and he was not he was denied a license and %HESITATION he was stripped of his heavyweight crown he gave up three and a half years of this prime career when he was at its peak as an athlete and his peak as a as a as a money order %HESITATION because he was on him because he was a political symbol I think I'm there a lot a legendary fights that are in the book we know with with Frasier with Ken Norton with George foreman %HESITATION and then this early age he just wouldn't quit I mean he he got beat by a young Leon Spinks and then came back and and he retired and came back so many times even after he really didn't have the discipline to train well and he would fight lesser opponents and this is a clip I want to play of some banter with the TV sportscaster Howard Cosell who had a long interesting relationship with Alli and this is a show where Cosell is ragging alley about what poor condition he's in in the kinds of fighters that he's that he's boxing arm Ali speaks for if you look at me and look at you I look better than you and your own box or what take shape after B. N. I. when all my fights dove that Doug it's not I wouldn't use it only if it doesn't end up and taken jacket off I wanted the public to see that let me let me ask you a question issue Clinton as you this pretend as much over one minute alright it's a disaster framework when I fold when awful say are all of the fellows that I've been fighting weight would you say that they were in shape yeah except for math as he didn't like Michelangelo how do you go twelve rounds because you aren't doing anything when it was a lot of fun and then handed it funds buried gone the trial will see it as your manager Angelo Dundee train isn't that's only Alex I don't know as he lands love Joe Frazier I wouldn't shake before Fraser medium sales all three but yet it was Joe Frazier who had to be under intensive care for one month waterfall McFaul studies to twenty sixty three the heaviest of mockery of mac falls to the of the days just got out of the hospital in Japan they wouldn't let him leave the country everybody I'm fighting league is end up in hospitals online scratched I'm on March I'm overweight I'm fat but yet I'm always women in what what there if I get in shape it'd be a murder would as a matter of fact you a record for our knockouts I mean one punch knockout Syze absolutely none exist you like the killer only one turned all along I have in my hand in the only company only are overweight you're not serious about your profession on an as is and it's about to be made by Angelo Dundee no long and I have and that is Howard Cosell and Muhammad Ali are always interesting to listen to those two guys Vietnam what why did alley continue to take all this punishment you you're right about his last two fights with Larry Holmes and Trevor Berbick they were just painful I mean a set wanted to keep doing this to himself not to the George foreman fight Elijah Muhammad begged him to quit and %HESITATION it he always obeyed Elijah Muhammad in every other way every other time %HESITATION you know it just beaten for many won the championship again and he fought in Africa is this great in a symbolic place to to be come champion again to beat the other they get the biggest baddest man on earth George foreman but he couldn't quit and he said I'm one of his managers told me you know he said they want to give me three million dollars to fight these bombs you know how I can turn that down this ridiculous at was I think it was almost entirely the money he had a lot of alimony to pay you know he was %HESITATION divorced twice at that point almonds just about to marry I'm his third wife he had this huge entourage that counted on for support he had a very nice lifestyle with a lot of homes and and he just had burned through all this money he had really no savings at that point even though he'd made you know tens of millions of dollars last time was in nineteen eighty one right arm any live for what three decades after that %HESITATION did a lot of charity work got the presidential medal of freedom in two thousand five we really became one of the most beloved Americans ever %HESITATION after doing all this research or what why do you think he touched so many people so deeply no it's a great question and I I interviewed probably five hundred six hundred people for this book and I asked a lot of them that question people who knew him really well on because I got to meet him but I didn't get to know him %HESITATION and I didn't get to interview him but to see this %HESITATION this guy who goes from the most hated man in the world to being the most beloved in many ways to being seen as this kind of a Saint arm is fascinating and I don't think we do Ali any good by treating him as a Saint he was a human being and he was deeply flawed but I think the reason %HESITATION people look to him this way is because he he had the spirit of a rebel and he was willing to fight for what he believed in and then when he got knocked down and we got hit with this with this disease when he when he started looking bad shaking in and stammering on TV he was afraid to let people see him that way and that's you know another kind of courage that he showed and I think people really began to them embrace him as he as he became more of a victim more of a martyr and %HESITATION you know that's complicated in and of itself it can do it we only love our our heroes when they're when they're weak %HESITATION I we've afraid to him to %HESITATION recognize all these greatness when he was at his as nastiest in his toughest %HESITATION but but I think that them you know people were just always felt this warmth toward him even when he was at his most outrageous because he said these things with this twinkle in his eye that said he just want to be loved all the time but Jonathan eig thanks so much for speaking with us again thank you Jonathan eig spoke with fresh shares Dave Davies who is also W. H. Y. wise senior reporter I'd is the author of the new book Ali a life year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the summer of love when in nineteen sixty seven tens of thousands of hippies flocked to San Francisco some people are looking back nostalgically styles and language of the music the fashions the out loaded expressions like far out and groovy but as our linguist Jeff number of points out it's striking how much of the language of that period is still with us as Jeff puts it we all speak Hibino if you're into counter culture kitsch you might want to check out the nostalgia themed resort hotel at Walt Disney World in Florida it features a hippy dippy swimming pool surrounded by flowers shape water jets peace signs and giant letters that spell out peace man out of sight and can you dig it fifty years after the summer of love that's been the fate of a lot of the language we associate with that era faded psychedelic sort of like acid rock in tie dye except that nobody ever tries to revive it well slang is like that the words come in on one tight inner swept out again on the next but it's actually striking how many words in the hippie era are still with us from up tight to bomber to freak show as brief as the moment was it changed the way we think and talk what people call the summer of love only lasted for about ten months in all most accounts dated start from January fourteenth nineteen sixty seven when twenty or thirty thousand hippies assembled in San Francisco's Golden Gate park for the first human bian the Grateful Dead and the Jefferson Airplane performed Allen Ginsberg chanted a Hindu mantra and Timothy Leary issue the movements marching orders turn on tune in drop out for awhile that spring it seemed as if love really could conquer all with a chemical assist the Haight Ashbury district teamed with spiritual seekers an acid heads Berkeley radicals and old North Beach beatnik they were trailed by journalist from Harry reasoner to hunter S. Thompson dispatched by the media to tell middle America what was going on the hippies wafted on a cloud of communal sweetness and bonded over the drugs in the music and they cemented their fellowship with blissed out superlatives like far out out of sight and the ubiquitous groovy which was actually a bit of warmed over bebop's line observers found the language vague and vacuous but that was exactly the point if you're trying to create a sense of tribal identity you don't want words that make your meaning explicit you want words that presume that that isn't necessary scene couldn't ever lasted it was a fleeting eye of calm in a period that Todd Gitlin once described as a cyclone in a wind tunnel and by mid summer it was falling apart grass in acid had yielded to heroin and speed and the hate was overrun with street people predators and runaways most of the bands in the original hippies decamped for more pastoral settings on October sixth nineteen sixty seven the counterculture purist called the diggers held a mock funeral carrying a coffin labeled hippies son of media and brought the summer of love to an unofficial and it wasn't the end of the hippie movement this was two years before Woodstock and Altamont the word counterculture hadn't even entered the language yet but by that point the media had fixed the cartoon image of the hippie as an unwashed acid head babbling about peace and love slang superlatives became panel through over exposure within a year the monkeys were telling their preteen fans that love is the ultimate trip by nineteen seventy one The New York Times music critic Mike John labeled groovy and where it's at is archaic and dismissed out of sight as something you'd hear in a suburban boutique in fact almost none of the hippies positive term survive the era the apparent exception with cool but the beats in hipsters had already made that part of the language a decade earlier but the hippies language had a darker side which proved more enduring millions of young people were embracing the hedonistic strands of the hippie lifestyle the long hair the music the pot but rarely in search of enlightenment most of them have little interest in the turn on and tune in parts of Leary's message but they took to heart the business about dropping out at least in spirit they weren't about to quit their jobs to join a commune but they came to share the hippies disaffection from the split level conformity of middle class American culture and they borrowed the hippies words to express its failings the hang ups cop outs and up tightness the plastic people and rip off artists who do a number on your head even the positive words were given new negative twists when the Grateful Dead first saying what a long strange trip it's been in nineteen seventy the word suggested a spiritual journey but now it more often conveys an unwholesome obsession has an ego trip power trip guilt trip the fact is that we're all fluent speakers of hippie now get the most persistent single pejorative term to come out of the era is hippie itself half a century after the summer of love the only honest to god hippies left in America are off growing pot in Mendocino county or baking artisan bread in Asheville but people are still using hippie and hippy dippy as condescending adjectives for a stock sit com character they bring to mind somebody who's into tofu drives a previous lives in a nuclear free zone and names their children river or willow and who has an excessive faith in the power of love I suppose that says something about the persistence of the original hippies vision even as remote and diluted as it is it's still compelling enough so that people need to invoke it just so they can put it down Jeff Lundberg is a linguist

seventy eight when she was twenty three her new book going into town is like a cartoon guide book to New York but his chest points out it's not really a guidebook nor is it an insider's guide about the hippest clubs in swanky S. restaurants it's about what she loves and which he finds most TV about Manhattan it's pretty hilarious Chaska up in an apartment building in Brooklyn which was pregnant with her second child chast with her husband and their three year old son moved from Brooklyn to a suburb about an hour away from Hatton years later when her daughter was preparing to move to Manhattan to attend college just put together a guide to Manhattan to show her suburban daughter how to get around and what to look out for chest new book is adapted from the one she put together for her daughter Russ chest welcome back to fresh air the first thing I want you to do is to read a short excerpt from your book we won't see the %HESITATION illustrations that your true but maybe you can describe some of them and this is apart title but first a little background it and it's the explanation for why you and your husband moved with your first child to the suburbs from New York when our son was almost three and I was pregnant with our second child my husband our son and I left Brooklyn for pretty leafy suburb about an hour north of Manhattan there are five reasons for this leap into the unknown one this was nineteen ninety the middle of the crack epidemic we've had it with crime the crack vials all over the sidewalk all of it and %HESITATION I'll describe for the listeners is a little drawing of my son sort of taking his toddling steps on the sidewalk in a park slope we were living in their crack files all over the sidewalk and he's saying mommy what that I eat that to free excellent public schools where we were going three my parents lived in Brooklyn for some people this would have been a plus that I had mixed feelings for sometimes when you grow up in a place you need to get away I saw Brooklyn differently from people who came there from Wisconsin or wherever behind every cute organic food store I saw the ghost of the sad dark %HESITATION difference gross read of my childhood there was nothing there for me five but the main reason was this we couldn't afford the space we needed the four bedroom house we bought in suburbia cost less than a crappy two bedroom walk up in Brooklyn even in nineteen ninety the decision to leave the city it was terrifying and here I have this little drawing of war figures starting and they're kind of like walking like zombies and my son is saying must play soccer my daughter is with her arm sticking out going need mall now and my husband is saying LAR one extremely important and I'm saying hello with our to collect symbols instead I didn't know how to drive I didn't like the idea of living directly on top of a boiler or furnace or whatever the hell was in a house basement I never lived in what my parents called the country also when we turn into Philistines zombies I was rushed fast reading from her new book going into town a love letter to New York so on this because of a funny cartoon version of what you told your daughter or the book you made for your daughter before she moved from the suburbs team New York to go to college was it hot for you used to bring up your daughter and the suburb when the idea of a suburb initially was so alien to you when you were so city it was strange but there were reasons for doing so %HESITATION one was that %HESITATION financially it made much more sense for us to bring the kids up in the suburbs so my husband works at home as to why and even a two bedroom apartment which we could never afford it anyway would not have been enough space we needed more space than not and that pretty much kicked us out of New York at that time and also the public school situation was not you know very good in New York back then I don't know what it's like right now I'm not involved in that because my kids are all out of that but I we were able to send our kids to public school where we moved and that and I like that so but it was very strange and in fact one of the things I mention this in the book that my daughter said I would take her to the city with me a lot and she looked at the fire escapes and she asked me she said mom what is West Side Story things and in this you know that from the movie wet side story from the posters that has stir in the album cover that had that yeah opponent yeah that's very famous graphic you know in it's a wonderful %HESITATION had a Romeo and Juliet shop yeah yeah you know with the fire escape on it but she had no idea what it was she recognized the look of it you know she recognize the graphic but she had no idea what it was I grew up with a fire escape and I was always afraid that some kinda like band deter criminal or murderer who is going to run up the fire escape and open the door to my bedroom window and like jump in I was found the kind of scary because of that once when they were like gunshots Alec behind where my apartment was when I was a kid I thought okay here they come if not how I know there is hiding from the police and claiming right up my fire escape I used to drag the couch cushions out there I would drag a couch cushion out in a book and it was you know Hey this is pretty cool talk a little porch eat your fire escape was big enough for you to do that yeah we had a fire escape that would fit a couch cushion wow no I've just tiny was is big enough to get your feet on in escape the fire if necessary I didn't mean to perhaps so seem right that the main wildlife in Manhattan this probably insects cockroach yes bed bugs silverfish you have lived in several apartments in Manhattan right yeah what was your worst Runnin in Manhattan with an apartment infestation I went up when I first lived on seventy third street I had a cockroach infestation %HESITATION which I didn't realize when I first moved in but one time I would move those ho horrible I came back %HESITATION after being out one night and I turned on the light in the kitchen and the kitchen was a sort of galley kitchen that didn't have a window it also didn't have a stove it I cooked on a hot plate which is a whole other story but %HESITATION it was like thousands of cockroaches it was like a cockroach convention it was so incredibly horrible it's just almost beyond describing and of course after that I you know told super and then they started getting of the %HESITATION exterminator coming in regularly and and then I would see an occasional cockroach but not like that what did you do one of those moments right after turning on the light I I can't remember I remember that it was like definitely one of those like back away like very bad feeling I don't know if I screamed I don't remember a truck I probably didn't scream but it was just like oh oh you know this is really bad and this is my apartment I live here and I'm sharing it with you know all the little fellows and then you went to bed and I went to bed yeah yeah because you know the start when the part when you put the light on the scatter them so they go back into the walls or whatever %HESITATION only to come back out again only yeah only to come back out again once they know your sleep you have a great drawing of a water bug and you're right hold water bugs like a cockroach who's been exposed to that Giganta find kind of radiation that you see an old sci fi movies Anya waterparks are huge they are huge they look sort of halfway between a cockroach in a mouse you know and they're really really big they are too big like I wouldn't want to just like step on them if I were wearing a flip flop for some a no no because they looked at it no I I don't wanna get graphic about it I actually after yeah yeah after seeing your your your drawing of a water bug I actually wanted to know for sure what's the difference between a cockroach in water but outside of that one's gigantic so I googled what about it immediately got I guess it's an add one of the extermination sites and so I thought I read you a little bit of what I found agrees cockroaches in water bugs are two entirely different types of insects but they're often mistaken based on their appearance the most common species of water bug is the giant water bug also known I love this also known as the tow biter yeah I think there are more the electric light bug or the alligator tech most pieces of what about a relatively large in at least three point eight centimeters long %HESITATION this my fair part water bugs have piercing mouth parts of and a short pointed beak on the underside of the head so I think it just made things just a little bit worse thank you yes I did the toll biter as I that's really bad booth again and they live they they actually live in like water replaces so pipe hand pipes yeah under laws where it's wet yeah yeah via so so much so great did you enjoyed drawing one oh yeah oh yeah so you grew up in Brooklyn apartment building and you describe how your mother kept a crutch around to bang on the ceiling when the upstairs neighbor made too much noise we all yeah iris when she did that I am I remember thinking about it as you know embarrassed %HESITATION you know when you're a kid there's so much that you just sort of take for granted because that's just like what your family does it's like my mother would serve spaghetti and she would put a scoop of cottage cheese about how out of it if if and I just thought that was sort of normal you know I thought well everybody does that because you know when you're a kid that's well you know all you know so I grew up in an apartment building and I was taking piano lessons as a kid and sometimes when I practiced piano the downstairs neighbor that the floor right below me they banged up if you try to do to stop and it was just like it was like getting a terrible review you know how and was it during the day yeah it would be during the day and if I didn't stop sometimes someone from the apartment downstairs would come up and kind of battle on the door and go like stop it and my god well I remember one time that neighbors upstairs even though my mother was banging with the crutch it sounded like somebody had a hammer and was banging on the floor even when she went upstairs finally because they wouldn't stop and it turned out that one of their kids actually had a hammer and was banging on the floor I mean that to me it's so astonishing because I guess I grew up in an apartment house that only lived in apartments and from the time I was able to understand English I got from my parents that we were living with other people and that you didn't bang hammers on the floor you didn't you know make a giant amount of noise like after nine o'clock at night you didn't blast your you know T. V. at eleven o'clock at night and I'm still very conscious of that I mean as I said I have a little place here now in if I put on the news you know after eleven I don't Blair it so what I think was as a result of your comic book length Mel more about your parents final illnesses and their deaths that you got an email from somebody who I think you didn't know that told you they had located the grave site of your parents first child who died %HESITATION well it it was not quite that direct what happened was she had actually she you're right you're right but she thought that it might be and she had counted on a website called find agrees which I'd never heard of them but she wasn't sure if it was she just thought it might be and when I looked into it it turned out it was so you had been keeping your parents cream mains the ashes from their cremation in your closet I remember you telling me about this the last time we spoke after the publication airmen more and then I read that you decided once you found their baby's grave that you would move their ashes to that cemetery so what we have what did you do well your first I made contact with the person at the cemetery to it you know wrote this letter in the next day he wrote back and said that you know those were my parents and that was there baby and I knew you know I didn't want them to be there you know ashes to be in my closet for ever I just didn't know where they should be because they had never really told me where you know they didn't have any particular place that they wanted their you know ashes to be so I met with him the guy the cemetery and he found a place for them there's even though you know cremation is not traditionally Jewish and this was a Jewish cemetery more people are opting for it and he told me that he had found the perfect needs for them %HESITATION which was in this wall that overlooked where the baby was buried and it was at the very top of this new Schwall it was %HESITATION the only one that was left in that particular part of the cemetery and the NY sh turned out to be J. two and my parents apartment was to Jay the apartment they had lived in for fifty years %HESITATION I mean if I had put that in a book the editor would have said %HESITATION that's a little tacky you know could you like maybe take that out change it %HESITATION but no that's really you know from too jaded J. two so that's where I brought them so for a couple of years so you'd be living with their ashes everyday the ashes were in your closet now they're in a cemetery do you visit the wall was there in turn no no I don't %HESITATION I think about them a lot but I don't have a big feeling about their Cremeans you know I think one saying about seeing both my parents after they passed was how clear it was to me that they were no longer there you know their body was not then whatever you know animates us was gone I think about them as I said all the time but to literally go and look at them vanish wall is not something that I feel any particular need to do so one more thing on your bio page on your website there's a terrific cartoon of the nine year old Ross chest sitting in bed reading the big book of horrible rare diseases did you have a book like that and as somebody who's so could visually attuned we were especially interested in looking at like rashes and wounds and just things that could go wrong visually with the bottle yeah yes yes yes but yes I don't know why I don't know whether it's some sort of weird vaccination against you know growing a second head %HESITATION %HESITATION I mean I find myself definitely in it too it it's terrible but I'm sort of attracted to that %HESITATION to looking at that I mean the body is as a sort of horrible thing it's a disaster and we all know that %HESITATION it's also sort of funny you know because we're on the same boat but it's basically a disaster %HESITATION and and terrible and how we have to compartmentalize this and yet I I like to look

state level we tap a journalist Mike species who's covered the gun lobby since twenty fifteen and writes for the trace he says one of the NRA's state level is to allow guns on college can Mrs and in daycare centers government buildings and bars it goes into their sort of core agenda normalize gun carrying his possible in American public life so that means putting guns in places where people don't

find pop culture happy hour on the NPR one act or where ever you get your pot after the massacre in Las Vegas well legislators tighten the laws regulating gun sales and background checks my guest Mike species is skeptical he's been covering the gun lobby since twenty fifteen spears writes for the trace an independent nonprofit journalism organization dedicated to covering issues related to guns in America he wrote a series called the gunfighters examining the national rifle association's influence on state policy and politics and how over the last decade the NRA has successfully lobbied state legislatures to roll back many restrictions on guns this week several prominent Republican members of the U. S. Senate and house live in the past oppose gun restrictions said they would consider legislation banning **** stocks a device which the shooter in Vegas used to convert a semi automatic weapon into one that functioned as an automatic weapon today the NRA endorsed tighter restrictions on bomb stocks speech points out **** stocks are gun accessories not guns so it's more difficult to argue that they are enshrined by the second amendment I spoke with my XP's about gun legislation and the gun lobby in Vegas and the larger strategies the NRA's pursuing on the state level my XP is welcome to fresh air so the NRA spent millions last year to fight universal background checks in Nevada the voters passed a universal background check ballot measure last November it passed by a very narrow margin but the Attorney General Adam Laxalt has chosen not to enforce the universal background check saying is enforceable so let's start with the universal background check could you describe what that the ballot measure set the ballot measure was asking of violence to vote on whether they wanted a thing called universal background checks so as it works now when you purchase a gun from a licensed dealer you have to undergo a background check but if you purchase a gun from a private seller or at a gun show you don't it's essentially unregulated so the ballot measure which call for universal background checks would expand that system X. to all kinds of gun sales and transfers which often you've probably heard people talk about %HESITATION the gun show loophole that's one of the loopholes in the law and that's what the the ballot measures extremity so on what grounds has the Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt said that this universal background check ballot measure is unenforceable it's a really good question because it's pretty unclear to me I mean even based on the opinion that his office issued it was %HESITATION fairly vague explanation I don't actually think that there is a good explanation for why it's on enforceable because there are nearly a dozen states that already have universal background checks and are able to force them so I don't know why it would be any different in a state like Nevada it wouldn't be it's not a different to me it is just more a matter of ideology I feel like I can say that because the Eiji had a position on this ballot measure before it was ever voted on and that becomes very clear when you see some of the ads that the NRA was running before November one of those ads featured Attorney General and Laxalt and Laxalt talked at length about how universal background checks would essentially gotten doesn't really say why but would essentially end up criminalizing or would effectively penalize law abiding to violence don't know I'm not again I'm not sure why would do that but his opinion was already fixed and also his allegiance to the NRA by appearing in in that video was also very clear so I'm do you think that if the universal background check was actually being enforced that it might have stopped the Vegas massacre might have stopped the shooter Stephen paddock well we know the heli spot some weapons from a licensed dealer and he was able to pass background checks to purchase those license weapons so if if he was able to do that and there's nothing in his record that's come out so far that suggests that he would have been a prohibited purchaser then no the universal background checks they wouldn't have prevented him from buying more guns but it's not beside the point to bring up the honorees effort to block that measure because it's just speaks to the larger way in which the honorees able to frame the entire debate over gun ownership and gun carrying in the country you know when you're when you're implementing universal background checks there's a cultural affect that occurs me good laws in general are supposed to teach people safe behavior and it's the NRA's responsibility to fight anything that would place any restrictions on gun ownership you've been focusing on the NRA's activity ing and lobbying on the state level the you're also writing about the federal level but it seems from your writing that the NRA's actually focusing more on the state than the national level why is that well the national in terms of the what happens with gun legislation at the national level especially over the last decade particularly with the start of the Obama administration is it's just really been total gridlock no legislation moves in either direction so there hasn't been a major gun bill that would expand the rights of gun owners hasn't passed at the federal level and in quite some time but what you have seen over the last ten years our bills that go in the other direction in the wake of new town there was that huge effort to pass universal background check bill or a bill that would essentially impose universal background checks in that that ultimately failed by fairly thin margin at a moment when it seemed like there was a huge hunger or desire on behalf of many Americans to see action but at any rate that's been the onerous task federally is just alt essentially to fight off what would be restricted but they would consider to be restrictive legislation that also includes what they got you know legislation that was push last year to close the tear gap which sought to essentially prevent anyone that was on the FBI's terror watch list fear on that watches to camp Borden airplane the army was off again born airplane you probably shouldn't be able to purchase a gun either but the NRA successfully beat that back as well at the state level the maps just been exceptionally favorable to the NRA especially since twenty ten when Republicans took control of a majority of state legislatures around the country and governors offices to so it's the place where they're able to advance gun rights and experiment so what you seen over the last decade is a proliferation of legislation that has been enacted that has allowed people to carry firearms in places that they've never mailed carry before that includes bars churches college campuses daycare centers government buildings that's ultimately at the core of their agenda is to normalize gun carrying as many places as possible until it just becomes as natural of a thing to see in society as any other accessory that people carry around so the underwriters working for this on the state level yes we did I didn't houses last year right basically what did every state legislator in the country unsourced blind scan was curious how many lawmakers were not only sympathetic to the honorees because Ross so overtly expressing a willingness to do its bidding we were able to do that now suspect focusing on the honorees grading system if you're especially loyal lawmaker then you get a grade of today or a minus or a plus and as it turned out more than half of the lawmakers I think was roughly fifty four fifty five percent of state lawmakers countrywide have an a minus or better from the NRA and then in a more granular sense and I think fourteen states you had legislatures in which two thirds of the lawmakers have a grade of a minus or better which is to say that the NRA and fourteen states have what this all to my something that approaches or is a veto proof majority so even if they if there was a governor who opposed legislation in those particular states which is happen before they have the numbers to override any any veto so why do legislator's care that much about getting a high grade from the NRA this isn't like the grade has become more important than any money you're gonna get from well that's true yeah that's true at the state level in part it is state level races are just with far more expensive than federal ones thread is if you don't have the good grades if you're a Republican specifically if you don't have the good grades and you can easily get primary it from your from your right flank which is something that has happened and the NRA will field a candidate to do that to you I there's a great great story actually from twenty twelve %HESITATION a very prominent state lawmaker in tennis season was Deborah Mager %HESITATION for years had been one of the NRA's most our allies in the state she had an a plus she was a very reliable vote and the NRA wanted to pass a piece of legislation there that ran into some obstacles from the state's business community so maggots ultimately decided to table the legislation she didn't even oppose it she actually is reflecting the will over carcass and the idea was that once it was tabled they would study it more but the NRA didn't like that so they spent less than fifty thousand dollars putting up billboards in her district essentially conflating Deborah Mager with president Obama and gun control in a completely it's it's hard to like really get across how ludicrous it was that that was what she was being punished for but also just because she's someone that had been really really great for them and then what they did was they fielded a candidate who had no political experience but who was further to the right on the political spectrum from her to run against her in the primary now I'm with the billboards in them was also like just one or two really simple you too bad advertisements characterizing her as a gun grabber and in like a month her ratings dropped she was someone who is very popular in her district and she wound up losing the primary and you do that once in just a few times every now and again it's enough to clearly put the to send a message if you're just joining us my guest is Mike species he's been writing about the NRA since twenty fifteen he covers the gun lobby full time is reported for the trace which is an independent nonprofit journalism organization dedicated to covering America's gun violence crisis we'll be back after a short break this is fresh air mmhm support

every month while learning real concepts physics and save forty per go to little passports dot coms so the NRA has lobbyists for every region of the United States but Florida has a dedicated lobbyist it has an NRA lobbyist all to itself and you describe her as one of the most powerful people in the out in our a and because of her power Florida has become a laboratory for generating new forms of gun protections so that lobbyist in describing her name is Marion hammer describe a position in the NRA and why she is so powerful %HESITATION she's just someone who's been there for an exceptionally long period of time and they pay her a lot of money to do her work as far as I think nearly two hundred thousand dollars far more than any other state lobbyist and because she's so when mashed in the culture of the state %HESITATION and because Florida is a state that has a very high population of NRA members she's able to function as an unelected legislator might often has more power than legislators doing and zepa tell governors what to do an Apatow Republican lawmakers there what to do of that and that is that is what she does she sounds like a very %HESITATION colorful person would you describe a little bit she is very colorful she is that less than five feet tall and she has a pageboy haircut and she carries a laser guided pistol in her purse and she is a very legendarily vindictive person who plays the kind of hardball politics and that's that's a putting a politely that people think of when they watch like house of cards but don't think of as being real she's almost a movie character television show character in that way so you saw that Marion Hummer the NRA lobbyists to Florida's very vindictive and that if you you know if you vote against an ebb and are a bill then you're gonna and you're gonna hear about it test so can you give us an example where she of worked against somebody who had voted for some kind of gun safety or gun control legislation sure %HESITATION last year there is a perfect example %HESITATION a representative named Charles McBurney who had an a plus rating for the NRA they're always vote was Marion hammer was the chair of the Judiciary Committee there and there is an attempt about to pass a bill that actually %HESITATION would have enhanced Florida's standard ground statute that bill actually passed this year but %HESITATION without getting into the nitty gritty of that la he also was a lawyer in addition to being a lawmaker any sot that the additional protections for shooters which is what the law or the bill proposed were unnecessary and would have made jobs for prosecutors impossible so she effectively killed the bill by refusing to put it on the at the counter of his committee after that happened he was also you know as far as it happened he was also in his final term as lawmakers and he was hoping to be appointed to like a circuit court in Jacksonville and was among the you know final three potential candidates for that position and it seemed like he was actually the the favored candidate for governor Scott and Marion hammer remembering what he did put together a huge campaign in which many thousands of NRA members send emails to governor Scott telling him under no circumstances to appoint Charles McBurney to the circuit court judgeship and very shortly after that happened Mick Bernie was not appointed to the circuit court judgeship someone else was and it was it was directly I mean say directly because of what he did you said that you drafted Florida's stand your ground legislation would you just recap for us what that legislation was in Florida was the first state to pass standard ground to discover the legislation was in Alaska about her role in drafting sure said Stanger grounds %HESITATION which as proposed in the Florida legislature in two thousand four enacted in two thousand five reformatted reconceived Florida's self defense law and by it the way it did that was it said that if you found yourself in a dangerous situation in public or any place you have a right to be that you did not have a duty to retreat the duty to retreat is crucial because that was part of self defense laws we knew it before standing ground you do not have a duty to retreat and you were allowed to respond with deadly force if you believe that your life is in danger so you say she drafted this legislation what does that mean it means that she in an array lawyers put the legislation together and brought it to lawmakers in the state three of them who were her close allies in the legislature and they sponsored and as everyone else in the legislature know that the bill was actually drafted by an NRA lobbyists everyone in the Florida legislature knows that every gun bills drafted binary lobbyist and that doesn't make a difference makes no difference I think a lot of you know the one the dirty secrets special in state politics this country's that lots of bills are drafted by lobbyists bun harden the bills that generate produces are of a very unique variety and no nobody nobody Democrats care but they've been in the minority for a very long time of the state so does it really matter what they think and %HESITATION Republicans don't care now so why is still underground important to the NRA it goes hand in hand with the normalization of gun carrying in public I think you know it's interesting that they generates co opted the term self defense to such a degree that when I think of self defense I don't even I I immediately associate it with a gun I don't actually think about that there's a whole bunch other kinds of self defense to commit anything I mean just defending yourself but that's important for the NRA because if you're going to enable people to carry guns concealed handguns in public which the NRA is is responsible for that through the organization that created the original right to conceal carry legislation then you also to some degree you a you also need a law that will facilitate or allow people to use their weapons in a way that they previously would not have been able to do if you're gonna give people the right to carry guns in public you're telling them that they need the guns because they have to defend themselves then standard Grannis away sort of co defying that message so Merrin hammer the Florida and are a lobbyist also created the model for concealed carry legislation what was the legislation that passed in Florida that you drafted it's really a relatively recent phenomenon that people you know are allowed to carry concealed handguns in public and not just their lab but states have to give that allow them to do it if they qualify for what is called the concealed carry permit and she created the permit system in Florida that essentially was you know that that has been the basis for every state's concealed carry permit system in the country and that concealed carry permit system is if you want to carry a handgun a public you have to apply to get a permit usually you have to pay a fee and you have to undergo some kind of training previously most states that a system in which only under video very specific circumstances would you be allowed to carry a handgun in this basically came around and said if you're a lawful gun owner you can carry a handgun a public songs you go through the very simple protocol to do so so while on the subject of concealed carry the NRA on the national level it's trying to make it so that if it if you live in a state where it's legal to have concealed carry you can do that in other states even where it's not legal would you explain that they think that if you get a concealed carry permit say in Utah or any state that your permit should function the same as your driver's license so if you have a driver's license and you tiger legally allowed to drive anywhere if that license right now though there are states that have agreements with other states another state is not required to recognize your concealed carry permit the legislation that they're proposing %HESITATION which is you know called resa prosecute for short would require states to recognize other states licenses even if even in New York for example you know which has a very strict in limited permit law my guest is Mike species he covers the gun lobby for the trace which reports

investing dot com still there were two real major high profile shootings in Florida one of them had to do was stand your ground that was when George Zimmerman shot Trayvon mount Martin and the other was the shooting at the post night club I'm on the massacre there so did either of those cases have any impact on Florida legislation did it change the minds of any of the legislators did it decrease in any way the NRA's power in Florida yeah I want to say this very in a very emphasized away in absolutely no way did either of those cases change anything in Florida in the wake of Trayvon Martin's death I think under public pressure governor Rick Scott did convened a panel that was going to study the law theory started lan offer perhaps potential solutions for making it better but in the end even though that panel was convened there was no change to statute law and after the post nightclub shooting democratic lawmakers in the state wanted to convene a special session of the legislature because the the time they were out of session to pass legislation that would at the state level close what I referred to earlier as the terror gap in the Republican lawmakers in the state immediately denied Democrats that desire and just said no it is entirely impossible to pass anything that approximates gun control legislation in Florida so on the state level the NRA is trying to pass certain legislation they're also trying to dismantle certain legislation you've written about how there are bills on the state level too and training and licensing requirements for concealed carry yeah that's probably one of the most popular pieces of legislation that comes up every single year at the start of state legislative sessions in most of the sessions are over now and I think several of those their call permit was carry bills basically those bills monster enacted render a state's permitting system obsolete means that once the state goes permit less you are allowed to as soon as seeming you can pass a background check you're allowed to go purchase a firearm a handgun and then you're just allowed to carry a concealed and public you know have to take any of the steps that a permit requires you to take which as you pointed out can and often includes training and always include some kind of payment sometimes fingerprinting you know if you want to do you're gonna have to like the least work for a little bit and I I I believe now the count and this is a very recent phenomenon just to be clear to sail quickly it spread the count for states that are now permit lists numbers it at about twelve so you know that's more than a fifth of all states in the country where you're allowed to carry a concealed handgun without getting a permit first so so one of the priorities for the NRA on the state level is allowing guns in places they were previously not allowed bars churches daycare centers college campuses public housing why is that a priority for the NRA yeah it's it it goes into their sort of core agenda which is again to normalize gun carrying as much as possible in American public life so that means putting guns in places where people don't traditionally see them and then sort of getting them used to the idea that guns are going to be there some of the places that you've mentioned college campuses bars for obvious reasons why would you want to go on an apartment people are drinking daycare centers or government buildings I mean these are places that previously and for most of American history are considered what out you might term sacred spaces the NRA adamantly opposes sacred spaces for water also called gun free zones something that often talks about in the wake of mass shootings %HESITATION because I need to sell the idea that an armed society is a safer society and that's if you have places where guns aren't allowed according to the NRA people in those places are sensually sitting ducks and are more likely to be killed so it's just key to the story the NRA tells about itself into its members which is that a good guy with you know the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun the good guy with a gun can only do that if he's allowed to appear she's allowed to have a gun anywhere so the NRA is in conjunction with an insurance company selling a new kind of insurance to gun owners called Carrie guard would you describe with ideas in April they launched an insurance program called Carrie guard and carry guard is under written actually by major insurer %HESITATION one of the most major insurers in the country well call Chubb and Cary guards essentially self defense insurance that's what they billed as and the point of the insurance is that you are covered or you get coverage for your legal fees and other related legal expenses in the event that you kill someone while claiming self defense very new kind of insurance throughout the first ones to watch it but this is different like the biggest entity to offer it and since they've watched at the marketing effort behind it is been pretty relentless and the way they sell to their membership is by saying you know essentially you live in an extremely dangerous society you carry a gun %HESITATION you should have to think twice about using your gun in a dangerous situation because you're worried that you're going to wind up going bankrupt after you do so get this insurance so you won't go bankrupt after you kill someone so I've interviewed a lot of people about the NRA and I still don't really understand why do they have the power that they have mean I know they represent the gun industry is the gun industry like that bid and that powerful I know they represent gun owners but a lot of gun owners are also really concerned about gun safety they want to use their guns for whatever sport they use it for target practice hunting or whatever but they don't want to see massacres %HESITATION so like what what's you cover the entire Hey what's what's your understanding of why do they have so much power I'm not sure there's a simple and satisfying answer to the question but I do think that people misunderstand the appeal of the NRA and what makes it a distinctly different entity for many other special interest group like for example the a a RP which is a group that has a fair amount of power were Emily's list the NRA is more than just a group that pushes gun rights it is much closer to a religion or like a very particular way of life and that's what it sells its members they say they have five million members which also is a pretty small portion of the populace but many of those members really do care in a way that is distinctly different then members of other special interest groups like the the a a RP generators become essentially an organ of the Republican Party it doesn't do anything for Democrats it hasn't for a long time and the fact that way it spends on election bears that out it spends essentially all of its money and quite a lot of money trying to keep Republicans in power putting new once in power so I say that because it's also useful for Republicans to sell the idea that the NRA has power because it enables them to keep their caucus together it's a symbiotic relationship the Republican Party in the NRA use each other and then of course as more practical matter especially since two thousand ten the NRA is spent well over a hundred million dollars on federal elections always ranking them among that the top outside spenders in last year no outside groups spend more supporting Donald trump's and the NRA did has president trump dumb things in support of the NRA you know right after he nominated neo Gorsuch to the Supreme Court he convened %HESITATION a small assembly of leading conservatives in the Roosevelt room at the White House and there's a picture of that that circulated and seated next to the president was the NRA CEO Wayne lapierre Wayne lapierre also appeared at the white house's Easter egg hunt Wayne lapierre appeared at C. pack into the conservative political action conference talking very openly about like this deep alliance that the NRA has of the trump administration when Donald Trump spoke he reciprocated by talking about the relationship going in the other direction so it's there is a P. R. element to this it reinforces the idea that the NRA has a direct line to the most powerful person in the country so if if we look at the massacre in Vegas is there any kind of gun policy that has been proposed or that has been enacted in any state that might have stopped shooter on the one hand I think it might be still too early to tell but one thing I do come back to where they sought about recently was the two thousand five federal legislation that passed him was enacted that essentially protects gun manufacturers from liability lawsuits do you know to be clear that means that victims of massacres are not able to sue gun manufacturers and like I certainly can't say that that would have prevented the massacre I do think that that's a necessary check that has been removed that allows manufacturers to not have to take responsibility for the arms that they put into the public that often have no justifiable civilian application then I guess one other thing %HESITATION one of the things that has come out is that a number of the shooters weapons what were semi automatics were automated or Sir were altered I should say with with an attachment that's called bump fire essentially turns a weapon into an automatic weapon and allows them to fire multiple rounds while holding the trigger down your finger instead of having to just continually pull the trigger to fire round after round and haven't been able to fire multiple rounds while holding down a trigger obviously allows you to spray bullets that's pretty effective winter spring into a crowd if you know twenty plus thousand people so legislation that would ban those bonfire attachments which has been proposed before I think by senator Dianne Feinstein and and I I believe she's brought it up again %HESITATION I guess that's a pretty direct and clear saying that would have it would it would put but potentially it had affected leased it to have made this less deadly then it was my excuse I wanna thank you so much for talking with us thank you so much red meat Terry was really wonderful Mike espy's covers the gun lobby for the trace after we take a short break Ken Tucker will review a new album by singer songwriter Ginny I co this is fresh air yeah same Xander's here one tell you by the only NPR show where you can hear about the latest White House drama and the return of TRL MTV show was called its venom and every Friday we catch up on the week of news culture everything every Tuesday I sit down for some long interviews with authors filmmakers directors and more you can find it's been a minute on the NPR one app for ever you get your pocket I rock critic Ken Tucker has a review of singer songwriter Ginny Aiko's new album called trip in recent years she's collaborated with other pop and hip hop artists such as Drake J.

A. dot org in nineteen eighty two director Ridley Scott sci fi detective thriller Blade Runner was released to good reviews but poor box office almost immediately the reputation of this dark dystopian view of the future began to grow and now after thirty five years there's a sequel called Blade Runner twenty forty nine Ryan Gosling is the new Blade Runner a police officer hunting artificial life forms film critic David Edelstein has this review anyone who saw blade runner in an empty theater in nineteen eighty two would be amazed by the excitement its sequel is generating I saw the film in the mid eighties at a midnight screening those being prime outlets pre home video for so called cult movies the visual universe eight Tokyo influence dystopia that's a do small mix of high tech and corrosion would color all dystopias to come and the call to Philip K. Dick who wrote the novel it's from do androids dream of electric sheep would grow exponentially now after adaptations of his total recall minority report and the man in the high castle as well as things he plainly influenced like the matrix and TV's Westworld you can't get away from his paranoid vision of a surveillance state in which memories are questionable and identities mutable so expectations are huge for Blade Runner twenty forty nine it's just okay too long at two hours and forty three minutes but absorbing director Denis villain of made arrival which was foggy visually and temporally and uses fog here too so the look is less hard edge than in the first film figures melt down of a rancid yellow smog and the corroded LA city scape with its giant beckoning Japanese female holograms it's more like San Francisco California is grey denuded of vegetation a desert and garbage dump Ryan Gosling is the new Blade Runner an LAPD officer called by the letter K. he's a hunter of artificial humans replicants who is himself a replicant only a less empathetic model than the older ones he's assigned to kill the problem with those replicants introduced in the first blade runner was they developed feelings which made it hard to enslave them and also made them conscious of and furious about their built in expiration dates that's why the original Blade Runner ex cop Rick Deckard played by Harrison Ford had to kill them though his empathy took over and he flew off in the end with a replicant named Rachel Deckard is alive in Blade Runner twenty forty nine but I'll stop there because the director in a note read to critics at an early screening asked that we disclose as few details as possible but it's fair to say Deckard is a factor in the last act and one key to a long buried secret relating to the ongoing existence of old model replicants that's why case superior played by robin Wright insists kill everyone connected to that secret she says their society is built on a wall between humans and replicants if the wall falls there could be war replicants are already starting to organize the question hangs though is K. we'll be completely without empathy in one scene he laments that his childhood memories are implanted any doesn't have a soul twitches boss says you've been getting along fine without one but one look at Gosling and you know the boss is wrong Gosling does a lot of I acting he can make his or herbs look moist and innocent he can make them smile he certainly has something resembling a soul in his apartment he plays Sinatra's of summer wind while his holographic girlfriend leans on him reading books she seems soulful to this is a key element in Philip K. Dick's work machines would grow more human well humans humanity would rust before he died he read the original Blade Runner script and thought it left out his ideas the sequel has more like the side young woman played by Carla jury whose job is to manufacture memories I can reveal that Jared Leto plays an industrialist who does hideous experiments on replicants and that he has a female replicant assistant who's a terminator like assassin I can also say the end is overly sentimental and inconclusive studio obviously thinks it can squeeze a series from this you'll talk about the three way inter dimensional sexing that's novel but we do talk about Blade Runner twenty forty nine like you did about Blade Runner doubtful unlike the original its mysteries aren't that mysterious you'll be reasonably entertain but your mind I'm blown David Edelstein is film critic for New York magazine if you'd like to catch up on fresh air interviews you messed like this week's interview with New Yorker cartoonist Roz chast or two thousand six interview with Tom Petty which we rebroadcast Tuesday after his death check out our podcast you'll find lots of interviews to choose from shares executive producers Tony Miller our interviews and reviews are produced and edited by any solid Phyllis Myers Sam Berger Lauren Krenzel Freddy some on Theresa Madden lives eighty empire Challoner I'm Terry gross some %HESITATION and came blow an N. from across the sea it lingered the to touch your own head and the world will all summer long we sang a song then we stroll two sweethearts
